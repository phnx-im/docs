This chapter contains ideas and plans that have not yet made it into the specification.

## Non-pseudonymous homeserver/groups

It could be advantageous to have groups where the homeserver can identify individual members. This would be an option that could either be turned on or off on a homeserver or on a per-group basis. A variety of mechanisms would have to be adjusted for non-pseudonymous groups. It's also a question we want interoperability between pseudonymous and non-pseudonymous homeservers.

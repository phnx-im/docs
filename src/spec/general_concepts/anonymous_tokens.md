# Anonymous tokens

TODO: Write this section on how tokens work and according to which principles the AS hands them out.
TODO: We should be clear about what kind of tokens we have and for which endpoints. We might want to move this section to the general concepts chapter such that it comes before all endpoint descriptions. Then we can include in the endpoint description what kind of token is required for the specific endpoint, what timeframe each token type has, etc.

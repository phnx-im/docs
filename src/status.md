# Open MLS Infrastructure Project Status

## Update 0, July 22 2022

Today, we publish a [threat model](./threat_model.md) for an abstract homeserver that aims fulfills the functional requirements. The threat model also contains privacy and security requirements. This is a first iteration and just like the functional requirements, we expect this to be a living document that grows as we move forward with this project.

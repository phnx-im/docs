# Open MLS Infrastructure Project Status

## Update 1, Oct. 05 2022

The short chapter on [authentication systems](./authentication_systems.md#) we add to the book today provides an overview over existing approaches to authentication in secure messaging applications. The report is based on testing, as well as public documentation of the individual applications.

## Update 0, July 22 2022

Today, we publish a [threat model](./threat_model.md) for an abstract homeserver that aims fulfills the functional requirements. The threat model also contains privacy and security requirements. This is a first iteration and just like the functional requirements, we expect this to be a living document that grows as we move forward with this project.

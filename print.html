The report is based on testing, as well as public documentation of the individual applications.</p>
<h2 id="update-0-july-22-2022"><a class="header" href="#update-0-july-22-2022">Update 0, July 22 2022</a></h2>
<p>Today, we publish a <a href="./threat_model.html">threat model</a> for an abstract homeserver that aims fulfills the functional requirements. The threat model also contains privacy and security requirements. This is a first iteration and just like the functional requirements, we expect this to be a living document that grows as we move forward with this project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functional-requirements"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements">Functional Requirements</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the functional requirements of a homeserver. Before we detail the individual requirements, we first introduce the different roles that interact with the system.</p>
<p>Note that while the homeserver should ultimately provide the functionality described, the entity in the given role might have to keep state and perform protocol actions to interact with the homeserver.</p>
<h2 id="roles"><a class="header" href="#roles">Roles</a></h2>
<p>A large part of the infrastructure consists of the homeserver, which is operated by the <em>operator</em>. The homeserver exposes most of its API endpoints to <em>clients</em> of <em>users</em> that are registered with the homeserver. The remaining endpoints of the homeserver's API are accessible to <em>the network</em>, as well as <em>federated homeservers</em>. Individuals that are registered with other homeservers are <em>federated users</em> who run <em>federated clients</em>.</p>
<h3 id="operator"><a class="header" href="#operator">Operator</a></h3>
<p>The entity that operates a homeserver. It is assumed to have control over the domain they configure as the homeserver's <em>home domain</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-network"><a class="header" href="#the-network">The Network</a></h3>
<p>The network includes all entities that have access to the port exposing the homeserver endpoints.</p>
<h3 id="users"><a class="header" href="#users">Users</a></h3>
<p>Users are individuals that have registered as users with the homeserver and that are associated with a unique and immutable <em>user id</em> scoped by the homeserver's home domain. Each user also has a unique <em>user name</em>. Registered users can have one or more registered clients.</p>
<p>The user is ultimately the entity that other users authenticate before starting a conversation.</p>
<p>In the context of federation, users of a given homeserver will sometimes be called <em>local</em> users as opposed to <em>federated</em> users.</p>
<h3 id="clients"><a class="header" href="#clients">Clients</a></h3>
<p>A client is a piece of software associated with and run by a user. The client holds the key material used to authenticate (and thus the user) to other clients and their users. Each client is associated with a <em>client id</em> that is scoped by its user's ID.</p>
<h3 id="federated-homeservers"><a class="header" href="#federated-homeservers">Federated Homeservers</a></h3>
<p>Other instances of the homeserver that are reachable via the network, where both the local and the federated homeserver have been configured to allow mutual federation. Each is assumed to be configured with its own home domain.</p>
<h3 id="federated-users"><a class="header" href="#federated-users">Federated Users</a></h3>
<p>Individuals that have registered with a federated homeserver in the same way as users have with the local one.</p>
<h3 id="federated-clients"><a class="header" href="#federated-clients">Federated Clients</a></h3>
<p>Federated clients are clients which are run by federated users. They are regular clients that are associated with a federated user instead of a local user.</p>
<h2 id="functional-requirements-for-each-role"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-for-each-role">Functional Requirements for each Role</a></h2>
<h3 id="functional-requirements-for-homeserver-operators"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-for-homeserver-operators">Functional Requirements for Homeserver Operators</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Homeserver management: Operators MUST be able to configure the homeserver and manage its users locally.</li>
<li>Homedomain setup: Operators MUST be able to set the home domain of the homeserver during setup.</li>
<li>Federation configuration: Operators MUST be able to configure federation: Either by allowlisting other homeservers by their home domain, or by allowing open federation except for a blocklist of home domains for homeservers with which federation is not desired.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functional-requirements-for-the-network"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-for-the-network">Functional Requirements for the Network</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>User registration: Entities in the public network MUST be able to register a new user.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functional-requirements-for-users"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-for-users">Functional Requirements for Users</a></h3>
<p>The distinction between users and their clients is difficult because the user will perform most of their interactions with the homeserver through the client. The following is a list of operations performed through the client, which concern the user as their own entity and might thus also affect all of their clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Client management: Users MUST be able to manage clients (this includes updates to client key material).</li>
<li>Account reset: Users SHOULD be able to reset the account. Members of groups the user is in MUST be notified of the reset.</li>
<li>User name change: Users MUST be able to change their user name. Members of groups the user is in MUST be notified of the new name.</li>
<li>User discovery: Users MUST be able to discover other users.</li>
<li>Connection establishment: Users MUST be able to initialize a connection with previously discovered users (via a two-user MLS group, implies retrieval of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#section-11">KeyPackages</a> of all of the other user's clients).</li>
<li>Connection rejection: Users MUST be able to accept or reject a connection initialized by another (local or federated) user. The sender of the connection request SHOULD be notified of the acceptance or rejection of the request.</li>
<li>Connection management: Users SHOULD be able to block other (local or federated) users s.t. they don't receive messages from that user anymore. Users SHOULD be able to unblock previously blocked users.</li>
<li>Account deletion: Users MUST be able to delete their account. Members of groups the user is in MUST be notified of the deletion.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functional-requirements-for-clients"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-for-clients">Functional Requirements for Clients</a></h3>
<p>MLS natively provides a number of group management mechanics such as membership management. The homeserver's task is thus to fulfill the role of an MLS <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-mls-architecture-08.html#section-4">Delivery Service</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group creation: Clients MUST be able to initialize an MLS group.</li>
<li>Group deletion: Clients MUST be able to delete an MLS group.</li>
<li>Message delivery: Clients MUST be able to asynchronously send <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#section-7">MLS messages</a> to all members of an MLS group that it is a member of (this implies the &quot;filtering server&quot; role specified by the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-mls-architecture-08.html#section-4.3">&quot;delivery of messages&quot;</a> requirement of the MLS architecture document). If a given group member has provided the homeserver with a notification for this group, the homeserver MUST attach the notification policy to the message when delivering it. If a group member is a federated client, the homeserver MUST forward the message to the federated homeserver for delivery.</li>
<li>Message queuing: The homeserver MUST store messages sent to a client either by itself or forwarded by a federated homeserver while the client is offline.</li>
<li>Message notifications: Clients MAY provide the homeserver with a means to notify them when a new message is queued, as well as a default notification policy. If the client has provided the homeserver with such a means and corresponding policy, the homeserver MUST notify the client according to either the policy attached to the message, or, if none was attached, according to the default policy.</li>
<li>KeyPackage retrieval: Clients MUST be able to retrieve <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#section-11">KeyPackages</a> for clients of users with a previously established connection (this implies the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-mls-architecture-08.html#name-key-storage">&quot;key storage&quot;</a> requirement). As long as there is more than one KeyPackage, the server MUST delete the KeyPackage after it was provided to a (local or federated) client.</li>
<li>Welcome message delivery: Clients MUST be able to send <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#section-13.4.3.1">Welcome</a> messages to clients of users with a previously established connection. If the client has provided the homeserver with a means of notification (and default notification policy), the homeserver MUST notify the client according to the default policy.</li>

<p>The requirements sketched above provide a good distribution of services across modules within the homeserver. Here, we provide a list of modules, as well as the functionality we expect them to provide to users and their clients.</p>

<h2 id="architecture"><a class="header" href="#architecture">Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The following shows a simplified interface between client and homeserver. Note, that for some of the security requirements (which we will detail in a later report), we might add one or more additional modules. For example, we will likely add a module that provides DDoS protection.</p>
<p><img src="images/homeserver_interface.png" alt="Simplified interface for client ↔ backend communication." /></p>
<p>Simplified interface for client ↔ backend communication.</p>
<h2 id="federated-architecture"><a class="header" href="#federated-architecture">Federated Architecture</a></h2>
<p>We will later generalize the above architecture to work in a federated setting. The general principle here is that individual clients only ever communicate through their own homeserver, so if a client’s query is w.r.t. another client, user or group that exists on another backend, that query will be forwarded accordingly. The target client/user/group’s homeserver is implicit in the GroupId/UserId/QueueId in question.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="performance-goals"><a class="header" href="#performance-goals">Performance goals</a></h1>
<p>The goal of the homeserver(s) is to facilitate messaging for consumers in general and in particular consumers with resource constrained devices such as smartphones running. Despite the advances in battery capacity, memory and computational performance in modern smartphones, consumers should still be able to communicate with the infrastructure without incurring disproportionate resource consumption. Additionally applications should be able to use the infrastructure without requiring exceptions to the restrictions that platforms running on modern smartphones (Android, iOS) impose on applications such as limited computation time when running in the background.</p>
<p>Similarly, homeserver operators should be able to run their servers without a significant overhead in costs due to computation, memory or persistent storage.</p>
<p>Quantifying performance goals is hard, since the hardware differs significantly across vendors. However, since cryptography is going to make up the largest consumer of computation time, as well as memory and persistent storage, we are going to use asymmetric cryptographic operations (public key encryption, signatures) as unit of measurement for computational overhead and number of keys that need to be stored as unit of measurement for memory and persistent storage overhead. This has the added advantage that we can later estimate the additional overhead in case of adoption of a Post-Quantum secure scheme with significantly larger key sizes.</p>
<h2 id="client-queries"><a class="header" href="#client-queries">Client Queries</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Network overhead: Clients should be able to perform the most commonly used queries (i.e. send a message to a group or retrieve messages from their queue) with a single round-trip. In particular, it should be possible to request own messages in batch, although the service might limit the size each batch of messages retrieved at a time, leading to additional round trips.</li>
<li>Computational overhead: The estimated computational cost for a given query heavily depends on the type of query. Let n be the number of member in a given group.
<ul>
<li>Simple (application) message to a group: One asymmetric operation for both sender and receiver</li>
<li>Message updating encryption key material: Less than 3log(n) asymmetric operations for the sender and less than log(n)</li>
<li>Message updating authentication key material of adding/removing a group member: Same as updating encryption key material plus &lt;10 asymmetric operations per joining client</li>
<li>Joining a new group: between 5n and 10n asymmetric operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance constraints are especially important if the respective operations are potentially performed in the background, i.e. when a user is not currently interacting with the client.</p>
<h2 id="homeserver-processing"><a class="header" href="#homeserver-processing">Homeserver Processing</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Network overhead: Homeservers should typically respond to one message with one response, although fan-out of a message can result in additional messages sent over the network in a federated setting. Note, that disproportionate amplification of network traffic (i.e. one client request causing a number of server requests) will be mitigated by rate limiting measures such as traditional IP-based rate limiting and schemes such as Privacy Pass.</li>
<li>Computational overhead: With the exception of the group joining cost, the computational cost of the server will be roughly equivalent to that of a client processing a given message.</li>
<li>IO overhead: A query from a client should result in at most one read and one write operation from/to the homeserver’s database, although we expect caching to reduce the number of reads significantly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-overhead-due-to-rate-limiting"><a class="header" href="#additional-overhead-due-to-rate-limiting">Additional Overhead due to Rate-Limiting</a></h2>
<p>More sophisticated rate limiting measures, such as the Privacy Pass protocol might create additional overhead, such as an occasional additional round-trip and asymmetric operation to retrieve an access token from the homeserver. We estimate the required frequency of this kind of operation to be at most once per day.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="threat-model"><a class="header" href="#threat-model">Threat model</a></h1>
<p>This document contains a threat model for an MLS homeserver. For now, this threat model is based solely on its functional requirements. As we build the specification of the homeserver, we will update this document to consider any additional assets.</p>
<h2 id="functional-requirements-1"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-1">Functional requirements</a></h2>
<p>The homeserver is expected to fulfill the functional requirements described <a href="./functional_requirements.html">here</a> and to interface with parties fulfilling the roles outlined in that document.</p>
<h2 id="mls-as-underlying-protocol"><a class="header" href="#mls-as-underlying-protocol">MLS as underlying protocol</a></h2>
<p>The homeserver facilitates communication between clients via the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, which already provides a number of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-mls-architecture-08.html#name-intended-security-guarantee">security guarantees</a> which we do not describe here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="threat-model-methodology"><a class="header" href="#threat-model-methodology">Threat model methodology</a></h1>
<p>We describe our threat model by roughly following the STRIDE framework as outlined <a href="https://www.securesoftware.nl/resources/FrameworkSecureSoftware_v1.pdf">here</a>. However, we modify the methodology slightly to fit use-case.</p>
<h2 id="authentication"><a class="header" href="#authentication">Authentication</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;Authentication&quot; property as listed in the STRIDE model can apply to multiple entities in a given operation provided by the homeserver. For example, the <em>message delivery</em> action described in the <a href="threat_model/../functional_requirements.html">functional requirements</a> involves the client requesting that the homeserver deliver the message, the homeserver receiving and processing the request, a potential federated homeserver that stores and forwards the request and finally the user receiving the message on the other end.</p>
<p>We thus have three kinds of authentication rather than just one: Client to server (C2S), server to server (S2S) and client to client (C2C), all of which we consider as sub-properties of the authentication property of the STRIDE model.</p>
<h2 id="spam-reduction"><a class="header" href="#spam-reduction">Spam reduction</a></h2>
<p>Spam (outside of its potential for a denial-of-service attack on the homeserver) is a general risk for a messaging service. We talk about spam reduction rather than spam prevention, because we don't believe spam is a problem that can be avoided entirely in a privacy-preserving messenger and instead aim to reduce it to a minimum.</p>
<p>In the context of our threat model, we consider spam potential an additional security risk for every action that leads to messages being sent to users or that otherwise alerts the user, e.g. by triggering a notification. This is reflected by adding the security property <em>spam reduction</em> to the existing STRIDE properties.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="security-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#security-assumptions">Security assumptions</a></h1>
<p>The operator of a homeserver can leverage its conrol over the homeserver to influence if and how the homeserver serves its users. While the goal of the protocol should be to reduce the amount of control the operator has, there are a few assumptions that need to be made.</p>
<h2 id="operators-are-trusted-not-to-spam-users"><a class="header" href="#operators-are-trusted-not-to-spam-users">Operators are trusted not to spam users</a></h2>
<p>Homeserver operators can circumvent any server-side spam reduction mechanisms and will thus be able to send excessive amounts of messages to a user and their clients (or notifications if the user provides the homeserver with a means to notify them). While the client can impose its own spam reduction mechanisms that the homeserver operator can't circumvent, they will likely also impede the usability of the client.</p>
<h2 id="operators-are-trusted-not-to-deny-services-to-individual-users"><a class="header" href="#operators-are-trusted-not-to-deny-services-to-individual-users">Operators are trusted not to deny services to individual users</a></h2>
<p>The homeserver operator can control which user the homeserver provides its services to and to which ones it doesn't. Metadata minimalism already mitigates this problem to a certain degree, because in most cases, the operator shouldn't know who makes a certain request. However, some actions such as client management or user name changes require explicit authentication, allowing the operator to lock out users in a targeted way. Similarly, the operator can simply delete records of a specific user from the database, or deny a given user the ability to publish KeyPackages.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="application-assets"><a class="header" href="#application-assets">Application assets</a></h1>
<p>The homeserver will have to perform all actions listed for the individual roles in the <a href="threat_model/./functional_requirements.html">functional requirements section</a>.</p>
<p>To fulfill these requirements, the homeserver will keep the following state (information assets in STRIDE terminology). Each piece of state is annotated by the actions involved in its lifecycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group state (for message delivery, including associated metadata such as group membership lists)
<ul>
<li>Create: Group creation</li>
<li>Read, Update: Message delivery (with inline MLS group management)</li>
<li>Delete: Group deletion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#name-key-packages">KeyPackages</a> for retrieval by clients
<ul>
<li>Create/Update/Delete: KeyPackage publishing (publication of new KeyPackages implies deletion of old ones)</li>
<li>Read/Delete: KeyPackage retrieval (reading implies deletion, except for <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#name-keypackage-reuse">KeyPackages of last resort</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to any specific security requirements listed in the individual actions, the following general security requirements must hold.</p>
<h2 id="basic-confidentiality-and-authentication"><a class="header" href="#basic-confidentiality-and-authentication">Basic confidentiality and authentication</a></h2>
<p>All actions performed via the network (which includes all actions with the possible exception those of the operator, which may be local, command-line based actions) MUST use be performed through a unilaterally authenticated TLS 1.3 connection using the home domain of the homeserver.</p>
<h2 id="metadata-minimalism"><a class="header" href="#metadata-minimalism">Metadata minimalism</a></h2>
<p>Metadata that is not required to provide functionality at a later point in time MUST be deleted immediately. Similarly, all metadata that is not required to be stored in the clear MUST be stored encrypted-at-rest.</p>

<p>To fulfill the functional and performance requirements, as well as those for security and privacy, the homeserver will need to employ a number of cryptographic primitives, e.g. signature, authenticated encryption, etc. This chapter discusses the primitives required, as well as the choice of schemes that are used for the initial specification. As customary in other protocol specifications the set of schemes used by a homeserver is called the homeserver's ciphersuite.</p>
<h2 id="federation-and-cryptographic-agility"><a class="header" href="#federation-and-cryptographic-agility">Federation and cryptographic agility</a></h2>
<p>Each homeserver operator will have its own requirements with regard to the ciphersuite that they want to use. This could be, for example, due to the requirement for the primitives to be certified in some way, or to meet a specific level of security for organizational policy reasons.</p>
<p>The underlying Messaging Layer Security (MLS) supports agility for a number of reasons and homeservers should, too.</p>
<p>For the initial homeserver specification, however, only one ciphersuite will be supported, even though the design will accommodate the requirement for homeservers to advertise their ciphersuite support.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-cryptographic-primitives-and-schemes"><a class="header" href="#list-of-cryptographic-primitives-and-schemes">List of cryptographic primitives and schemes</a></h2>
<p>For now, the homeserver is anticipated to require mostly basic symmetric and asymmetric primitives to fulfill its functional requirements. This is with the exception of an unlinkable token scheme to enable rate-limiting while allowing clients to access the homeservers services anonymously.</p>
<p>Along with the list of primitives, the list also includes a concrete scheme for each primitive that will be used in the initial specification.</p>
<p>In addition to the scheme's fitness to facilitate the listed requirements of the homeserver (functional, security, privacy, performance), an implementation of each scheme has to be available and fulfill the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source with an OSI-recognized license</li>
<li>ideally implemented in Rust</li>
<li>actively and well maintained</li>
</ul>
<p>The RustCrypto suite of cryptographic implementations provides well-maintained Rust implementations of a large variety of cryptographic primitives and schemes. While they are generally not as highly optimized for performance as other available implementations, they provide a good baseline that is sufficient for a PoC homeserver implementation. In the future, we hope to upgrade any implementations we decide on for the PoC with similarly well performing ones that have formally verified properties such as functional correctness and secret-independent execution,</p>
<p>When it comes to the concrete choice of primitives and schemes, an easy choice for the initial specification is the suite of schemes in the “mandatory-to-implement” (MTI) ciphersuite of MLS, as it represents a compromise between security and good performance on a variety of devices. In particular, the primitives and schemes are</p>
<ul>
<li>Signatures: Ed25519</li>
<li>Hash function: SHA256</li>
<li>AEAD scheme: AES128-GCM</li>
<li>KEM: DHKEMX25519</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional recommendations for primitives that might be used in the homeserver specification are</p>
<ul>
<li>MAC: HMAC-SHA256</li>
<li>KDF: HKDF-SHA256</li>
</ul>
<p>While these are the schemes that should make up the first ciphersuite of the homeserver, the specification should remain modular, such that multiple schemes can be supported and different versions of the homeserver protocols can introduce or deprecate individual ciphersuites.</p>
<p>All schemes above have been well-tested in a variety of modern, cryptographic protocols (e.g. Signal, TLS). The only choice that might not be immediately obvious is AES128-GCM as AEAD scheme, since in many cases, Chacha20-Poly1905 is frequently used as a more efficient scheme on devices that don’t have hardware support for AES, most of those with ARM processors. However, with the most recent generations of ARM processors supporting AES instructions, AES128-GCM is a good choice for a first ciphersuite, given that support for multiple ciphersuites is planned for the future.</p>
<h2 id="unlinkable-tokens"><a class="header" href="#unlinkable-tokens">Unlinkable tokens</a></h2>
<p>Should unlinkable tokens be used to facilitate a metadata friendly rate-limiting mechanism, their performance is essentially to not ultimately represent a denial of service vulnerability themselves.</p>
<p>Since the Privacy Pass protocol is the only well-known unlinkable token scheme that has seen extensive real-world use and analysis, it is recommended as the protocol of choice for metadata-friendly rate-limiting. Besides its use in practice, it is also on the finishing stretch of the IETF standardization process. Privacy Pass defines a number of token types, each backed by another cryptographic scheme. Performance tests have revealed, however, that all schemes suggested in the draft specification are prohibitively expensive in terms of computational overhead in the various protocol operations. To mitigate this shortcoming, the authors of this document have proposed a new batched token type based on the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-ristretto255-decaf448/">Ristretto255</a> group (also in the process of IETF standardization), which has significantly improved performance over the schemes used by existing token types. These improved results come at a slight security cost, which can be mitigated by a conservative key rotation policy.</p>
<p>The authors have already performed initial performance tests justifying the effort and published <a href="https://raphaelrobert.github.io/privacypass-batched-tokens/draft-robert-privacypass-batched-tokens.html">a document</a> defining the new token type, as well detailing the security recommendations for consideration by the Privacy Pass working group at the IETF.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="specification-draft"><a class="header" href="#specification-draft">Specification (Draft)</a></h1>
<p>This section contains a draft of the MLS homeserver specification. It is currently in an early draft status, but the goal is for it to fulfill the <a href="./functional_requirements.html">functional requirements</a> and be the target for analysis via the <a href="./threat_model.html">threat model</a>.</p>
<p>Note that federation features are still work in progress.</p>
<p>The specification is split into subsections according to the modular structure of the homeserver. In particular, the specification covers the following modules.</p>
<h2 id="work-in-progress-authentication-service-as"><a class="header" href="#work-in-progress-authentication-service-as">Work in progress: Authentication Service (AS)</a></h2>
<p>This section of the specification is still work in progress. As such it is currently incomplete and subject to significant changes.</p>
<p>The <a href="spec/authentication_service.html">authentication service</a> deals with user and client management, as well as user and client identity. For each user, it keeps an AS user record that contains the user name, as well as identifiers and cryptographic key material of the user's devices. The AS also provides the necessary funtionality for <a href="spec/authentication_service/connection_establishment.html">discovery and connection establishment</a>.</p>
<p>When communicating with the AS, users and their clients authenticate themselves using their real identity. This is as opposed to the rest of the homeserver, where each user has a pseudonym that they use for authentication.</p>
<h2 id="work-in-progress-anonymous-authentication-service-aas"><a class="header" href="#work-in-progress-anonymous-authentication-service-aas">Work in progress: Anonymous Authentication Service (AAS)</a></h2>
<p>This section of the specification is still work in progress. As such it is currently incomplete and subject to significant changes.</p>
<p>The anonymous authentication module allows the operator of the homeserver to rate-limit homeserver access to users and federated homeservers. The AAS acts as a middleware gating access to the endpoints of all other modules with the exception of the user registration endpoint of the AS. Registered clients can obtain anonymous (Privacy Pass) tokens from the AAS, the quantity of which can be configured by the homeserver operator. These tokens can then presented to the AAS when accessing other homeserver endpoints.</p>
<h2 id="queuing-service-qs"><a class="header" href="#queuing-service-qs">Queuing Service (QS)</a></h2>
<p>The queuing service stores queued messages for each client and forwards messages to remote queuing services. It also stores MLS KeyPackages uploaded by clients that allow users to add connected users to groups. After registration with the AS, clients can create a pseudonymous group message queue and upload KeyPackages. The homeserver's DS can deliver messages to individual queues and ask the QS to store-and-forward messages to remote QS'.</p>
<p>The queues and KeyPackages of a user's clients are organized on the QS in a QS user record. This record is not linked directly to the user's AS user record and prevents the homeserver from gathering metadata of individual users. For more information see the homeserver's <a href="threat_model.html">threat model</a>.</p>
<h2 id="delivery-service-ds"><a class="header" href="#delivery-service-ds">Delivery Service (DS)</a></h2>
<p>The delivery service is fulfills the role of the service of the same name described in the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-mls-architecture-08.html#section-4.3">MLS architecture document</a>. Clients can use it to create new groups and deliver MLS messages to these groups. Group member management is transparent via the MLS-native member management.</p>
<p>Communication between clients and the DS is authenticated based on per-group pseudonyms. Each distinct pseudonym used by a given user on the DS is linked to the user's pseudonymous record on the QS via the <a href="spec/glossary.html#sealed-queue-config">ClientQueueConfig</a> of each of the user's clients. In particular, this means that a DS alone cannot correlate group memberships of a given user. While not very meaningful in the context of an individual homeserver, this separation of pseudonyms is more relevant in the federated setting.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="authentication-service-as"><a class="header" href="#authentication-service-as">Authentication Service (AS)</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we detail the different functionalitites of the authentication service. See the subchapter on <a href="spec/authentication_service/credentials.html">credentials</a> for more details on the credential types referenced in this chapter.</p>
<p>The AS detailed in this section represents only the base-line version. A more sophisticated version with additional features such as better cross-signing and transparency is work in progress.</p>
<p>For an overview over the security of the AS see <a href="spec/./authentication_service/security_guarantees.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration"><a class="header" href="#configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>The AS is configurable by use of the following configuration variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anonymous token timeframe:</strong> The amount of time which each client has to wait until it can obtain new anonymous authentication tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Default token allowance:</strong> The default amount of anonymous authentication tokens issued to each user in the anonymous token timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>Identity provider:</strong> Network address of the OpenID connect identity provider the authentication service delegates authentication to for account registration.</li>

<ul>
<li>Default: 90d</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maximal number of requested messages:</strong> Maximal number of messages that will be returned to a client requesting messages from a direct queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="as-state"><a class="header" href="#as-state">AS state</a></h2>
<p>The AS generally keeps the following state</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User entries:</strong> A database with one entry for each user account. Each entry is indexed by the user's <a href="spec/glossary.html#user-name-un">user name</a> and contains a number of sub-entries.
<ul>
<li><strong>OPAQUE user record:</strong> The OPAQUE protocol artifact that allows the user to authenticate itself via its password in queries to the AS.</li>
<li><strong>Client entries:</strong> Sub entries for each of the user's clients. Indexed by the clients' <a href="spec/glossary.html#client-id-cid">client id</a>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Client credential:</strong> The <a href="spec/authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credentials">credential</a> of the client.</li>
<li><strong>Token issuance records:</strong> A record of how many tokens were issued to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Activity time:</strong> Timestamp indicating the last time a client has fetched messages from the queue.</li>
<li><strong>Connection establishment KeyPackage:</strong> A key package used to encrypt information in the <a href="spec/authentication_service/connection_establishment.html">connection establishment process</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Direct queue:</strong> A queue similar to the fan-out queues on the QS.
<ul>
<li><strong>Queue encryption key material:</strong> Key material to perform <a href="spec/./queuing_service/queue_encryption.html">queue encryption</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Current sequence number:</strong> The current message sequence number.</li>
<li><strong>Queued messages:</strong> A sequence of ciphertexts containing the messages in the queue. Each incoming message is <a href="spec/./queuing_service/queue_encryption.html">encrypted</a> and is assigned the current sequence number, after which the current sequence number is incremented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ephemeral OPAQUE DB:</strong> An in-memory database that stores user-name or client-id indexed entries
<ul>
<li><strong>Client credential:</strong> Credential of the client that is being added to an existing user entry, or the initial client of a new user entry.</li>
<li><strong>Optional OPAQUE state:</strong> OPAQUE server state, only present in case of the OPAQUE online AKE flow, i.e. if a client performs 2FA, but not during an OPAQUE setup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AS credential key material:</strong> Credentials that can be retrieved by clients, as well as the private key material used by the AS to sign client <a href="spec/authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credential-signing-requests">CSRs</a>.</li>
<li><strong>AS OPAQUE key material:</strong> OPRF seed, server public key and server private key as required for the server to perform OPAQUE registration a login flows with clients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authentication-1"><a class="header" href="#authentication-1">Authentication</a></h2>
<p>There are three modes of authentication for endpoints on the AS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>None:</strong> For endpoints that are meant to be publicly accessible, e.g. user account registration</li>
<li><strong>Client Credential:</strong> A signature over a time stamp using the signature key in the calling client's ClientCredential. The request additionally contains the calling client's ClientCredential.</li>
<li><strong>Client Password:</strong> An OPAQUE login flow.</li>
<li><strong>Client 2FA:</strong> The same as <strong>Client</strong>, but additionally performing an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/">OPAQUE</a> login flow</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initiate-2fa-operation-1"><a class="header" href="#initiate-2fa-operation-1">Initiate 2FA operation</a></h2>
<p>The client has to query this endpoint before it can query an endpoint that requires <strong>Client 2FA</strong> authentication. Note that this endpoint is not meant to be used with endpoints that require <strong>Client Password</strong> authentication such as the client addition endpoint. Similarly, this endpoint is not meant to be used to set up 2FA (see <a href="spec/./authentication_service.html#initialize-user-registration">here</a> instead).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="future-work-evolving-identity-eid"><a class="header" href="#future-work-evolving-identity-eid">Future work: Evolving Identity (EID)</a></h1>
<p>On a high level, the evolving identity represents a user's identity, which in turn is composed of the cryptographic identities of all of the user's devices.</p>
<p>More concretely, this is implemented using an MLS group that includes all of a user's clients, with the group's <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#name-ratchet-tree-concepts">ratcheting tree</a> representing the user's EID state.</p>
<p>Users update their EID by performing commits in the group using <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-mls-protocol-16.html#name-message-framing">MLS plaintexts</a> as their framing.</p>
<h2 id="the-eid-state"><a class="header" href="#the-eid-state">The EID state</a></h2>
<p>The EID state is the ratcheting tree of an MLS group that contains all of a user's devices. It defines the user's cryptographic identity, but it's also the place of publication for the <a href="spec/authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credentials">client credentials</a> of all of the user's clients.</p>
<p>The leaves in the EID state thus don't contain Leaf Credentials like the leaves in other groups, but instead contain the client credential of the client represented by the leaf.</p>
<p>The EID state is managed by the client, but published by the AS and held by all clients that communicate with the user.</p>
<h2 id="client-management"><a class="header" href="#client-management">Client management</a></h2>
<p>The EID is the authoritative list of the user's clients. Any change to the user's line-up of clients thus needs to be first made in the EID.</p>
<p>Since the EID is at its core an MLS group, changes to a user's device can be made using MLS membership management operations such as commits to update, add and remove proposals.</p>
<p>Any commit to such a change needs to be sent to the AS for publication, but also to all of the user's groups. In order for all these parties to be able to track changes to the user's identity, the commit needs to be in an MLS plaintext message. Any recipient of such a commit can validate the visible information in the commit, and in particular verify the signature against the current state of the EID.</p>
<h3 id="cross-signing"><a class="header" href="#cross-signing">Cross-signing</a></h3>
<p>One goal of the EID is to implement two-directional client cross signing, i.e. have both the adding client and the added client confirm the addition with their signatures. To achieve this, recipients of a commit to the EID that contains a client addition MUST wait for a second commit sent by the new client that only contains an update by that client.</p>
<h2 id="future-work-user-id-changes"><a class="header" href="#future-work-user-id-changes">Future work: User ID changes</a></h2>
<p>In a future iteration, users will be able to change their user name by terminating their existing EID and starting a new one. The old and the new EID group will be cross-linked to one-another cryptographically to ensure that the user name change is fully authenticated.</p>
<h2 id="future-work-as-tickets"><a class="header" href="#future-work-as-tickets">Future work: AS tickets</a></h2>
<p>There is currently no way for other clients to judge how recent a given EID state is. Having a strict bound on how recent an EID is required to be is important to ensure prompt propagation of client removal. Adding a &quot;ticket&quot;, i.e. a signed message from the AS containing a time stamp and the hash of the EID state could help with this.</p>
<p>The protocol would then be extended by requiring clients to regularly upload a ticket attesting the validity and recency of the EID state currently uploaded to the group. Clients receving a message from another client could then always require that the client's AS ticket be recent (for a configurable definition of &quot;recent&quot;).</p>
<p>It's not clear yet, though, what exactly the AS should sign, since it doesn't know the ciphertext used in each group, so it can only sign the plaintext, which the DS can't check.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="future-workwork-in-progress-registering-a-new-device-when-using-evolving-identity"><a class="header" href="#future-workwork-in-progress-registering-a-new-device-when-using-evolving-identity">Future work/Work in progress: Registering a new device when using Evolving Identity</a></h1>
<p>To register a new client, the user needs to be in possession of one of his existing clients. To properly perform the <a href="spec/authentication_service/evolving_identities.html">evolving identity</a> (EID) operation and securely transfer data from the existing client to the new client, this chapter defines a protocol between new client, the owning user's homeserver and an existing client. The protocol proceeds roughly in the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a channel between new client and old client via the homeserver's rendez-vous service (defined below)</li>
<li>Secure the channel with mutual authentication with the help of the user and a Password-authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)</li>
<li>Use the secure channel to exchange the information required to add the new client to the user's EID</li>
<li>Add the new client to the user's EID</li>
<li>Transfer user-specific secrets from existing client to new client via the secure channel</li>
<li>Perform the remaining set-up of the new client using the user-specific secrets (QS client record creation at QS, KeyPackage publiction, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rendez-vous-service"><a class="header" href="#rendez-vous-service">Rendez-vous service</a></h2>
<p>The existing client and the new client need to communicate in multiple round trips to complete the registration of the new client. The user's homeserver facilitates this by providing a rendez-vous service (RS), which acts as a network proxy between existing and new client.</p>
<p>The RS allows a new client to request a rendez-vous code (RC), which consists of a 16bit randomly generated byte-string.</p>
<p>The new client then establishes a connection to the RS and waits for the new client to also establish a connection using the same RC.</p>
<p>For the new client to establish a connection, the new client displays the RC for the user to manually enter on the new existing (along with the password for the subsequent PAKE, see below).</p>
<p>Once both clients have established a connection, the RS acts as a proxy, forwarding incoming messages from one client to the other.</p>
<p>Due to UX constraints, the new client is expected to initiate the process, which means that the RS has to provide a public (unauthenticated) interface to facilitate the first step. As a result, this interface should be subject to strict (traditional) rate-limiting measures.</p>
<p>The existing client is already registered with the homeserver can be expected to present an <a href="spec/authentication_service/../general_concepts/anonymous_tokens.html">anonymous token</a> when it's connecting to the RS, thus enabling at least partial rate-limiting.</p>
<h2 id="mutual-authentication-between-new-and-existing-client"><a class="header" href="#mutual-authentication-between-new-and-existing-client">Mutual authentication between new and existing client</a></h2>
<p>Once the network channel is established via the RS, the two clients perform an <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-spake2-26.html">SPAKE2</a> handshake to agree on a key, which they subsequently use to encrypt all messages sent over the RS channel.</p>
<p>SPAKE2 requires that the two clients share a password. The password is randomly generated by the new client and displayed to the user such that it can enter it (along with the similarly displayed RC) into the existing client.</p>
<p>The SPAKE2 PAKE consists of two phases. In each phase, both clients send one message to the other client. After generating the password, the new client can complete phase 1 and send its message to the existing client. Once the password (and RC) was entered into the existing client, it can also send its message for phase 1 and retrieve the message from the new client.</p>
<p>Both clients use the other client's message to complete phase 1 and exchange the messages of phase 2 via the RS.</p>
<p>After completing both phases, the clients have agreed on a symmetric key, which they can use to encrypt further messages using an AEAD algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-new-client-to-the-users-eid"><a class="header" href="#adding-the-new-client-to-the-users-eid">Adding the new client to the user's EID</a></h2>
<p>The new client now creates a <a href="spec/authentication_service/../authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credential-signing-requests">Client Credential Signing Request</a> and sends it to the existing client. The existing client in turn signs it with its own client credential private key and submits it to the AS for signing. The existing client then forwards the AS' response to the new client.</p>
<p>With its signed Client Credential, the new client can now create a KeyPackage (which includes the Client Credential) for the EID and send it to the existing client. The existing client subsequently uses the KeyPackage to create the commit adding the new client to the EID and submits it to the AS. The existing client then sends the resulting Welcome, as well as the following user-specific secrets to the new client.</p>
<ul>
<li>user base secret</li>
<li>QS user auth key</li>
<li>friendship secret</li>
</ul>
<p>The existing client also sends group joining bundles for all of the user's groups. The group joining bundle allows the new client to perform an external commit in all groups that the user is a part of. It contains the following group-specific data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Group ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group state EAR base secret</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credential encryption base secret</p>

<li>

<ul>
<li>It might be more than 16bit if the 16bit space was exhausted by an adversary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new client samples a 16bit random string and prompts the user to enter both the rendez-vous code and the random string into the existing client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new client uses the random string and the rendez-vous code to perform the first part of an SPAKE2 handshake, where the random string is used as the password and the rendez-vous code is used as the identity. It then establishes a websocket connection with the AS using the rendez-vous code and uploads the SPAKE2 outgoing message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The existing client performs the responder's part of the SPAKE2 handshake and also establishes a websocket connection to the AS using the rendez-cous code. It then uploads the resulting outgoing message to the AS, picking up the new client's outgoing message in the process and completes the first phase of the SPAKE2 handshake.</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The existing client downloads and validates it and uses the KeyPackage to add the new client to the EID. It sends the resulting commit to all other existing clients and the AS. The existing client also adds the new client to the user's all-clients group. It then uploads the Welcome for the EID and the all-clients group to the AS. Note that the Welcome for the all-clients group contains the EAR secrets for the group.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="discovery-and-connection-establishment"><a class="header" href="#discovery-and-connection-establishment">Discovery and connection establishment</a></h1>
<p>Discovery allows users to find other users based on their user name and establish a connection with them. The connection establishment process establishes a <em>connection group</em> that consists of the devices of both connected users, but otherwise functions like a regular group with the exception of the group creation process.</p>
<p>Once two users have a <em>connection</em>, they can add one-another to groups.</p>
<p>The creation process of a connection group is restricted by two considerations: Until the responding user makes its decision to accept the connection, the initiator is considered untrusted and should not be able to push arbitrary content to the responder. That is with the exception of the initiator's user name which the responder can use to identify the initiator.</p>
<p>The second consideration is that neither of the homeservers involved (with the initiator and reponder potentially belonging to two federated homeservers) should know who is connected to whom. This is not straight-forward, as the initiator has to be able to discover the responder by its real user name and use the discovered information to initiate the process.</p>
<h2 id="connection-group-creation"><a class="header" href="#connection-group-creation">Connection group creation</a></h2>
<p>To allow connection establishment in the first place, every client of a user publishes a special <em>connection establishment KeyPackage</em> with the AS which contains the client's <a href="spec/authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credentials">client credential</a> instead of the Leaf Credential that is used in other KeyPackages.</p>
<p>When discovering a user, the initiator fetches the connection establishment KeyPackages of all of the user's clients. The next step if for the initiator to create a group that contains all of the initiator's clients. The initiator then sends a <code>ConnectionEstablishmentPackage</code> to the responder's clients.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct ConnectionEstablishmentPackage {
    sender_client_credential: ClientCredential,
    connection_group_id: GroupId,
    connection_group_ear_key: GroupStateEarKey,
    connection_group_credential_key: CredentialEarKey,
    // TBS: All information above signed by the ClientCredential.
    signature: Signature,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>ConnectionEstablishmentPackage</code>s are then signed using the initiator's client credential and each encrypted under the init key of the connection establishment KeyPackage of the responder's individual clients.</p>
<p>Receiving the <code>ConnectionEstablishmentPackage</code>, a responder's client first makes sure that its queue on the QS is empty. This is to ensure that the responding user hasn't already accepted the connection on another client. If there is a WelcomeBundle with the same GroupId as in the <code>ConnectionEstablishmentPackage</code>, the client uses the former to join the group and discards the <code>ConnectionEstablishmentPackage</code>.</p>
<p>If the queue is empty, the receiving client must verify the signature on the package. It must also fetch the AS credential and AS intermediate credential and verify the signature chain from the initiator's client credential to the AS credential. The responder can then decide based on the sender's user name (contained in the client credential) if it wants to accept the connection.</p>
<p>The responder accepts the connection by fetching the external commit information required to join the group from the initiator's DS and joins the group via the <em>join connection group</em> endpoint of said DS. After joining, the client adds all other clients of the same user to the group.</p>
<p>If joining via the <em>join connection group</em> endpoint fails, the new client must check its queue again to ensure that no other client has accepted the connection in the mean time. If the queue is still empty, the client discards the ConnectionEstablishmentPackage and aborts the process.</p>
<h3 id="future-work-additional-initiator-information"><a class="header" href="#future-work-additional-initiator-information">Future work: Additional initiator information</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, the responder might want to get additional information to validate the responder, such as a display name or a profile picture. The responder should not get this information delivered immediately, but instead it should be downloaded upon active request by the responder.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="authentication-security-guarantees"><a class="header" href="#authentication-security-guarantees">Authentication security guarantees</a></h1>
<p>In this document, we outline how the Phoenix homeserver protocol facilitates end-to-end authentication in this first phase of the project. This first approach will provide a baseline of authentication guarantees for users that is comparable to commonly used messaging applications. In a future version, we intend to provide more extensive authentication guarantees that go significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art in secure messaging. Among other things, <a href="spec/authentication_service/evolving_identities.html">evolving identity</a> will be a central part of v2 of the Phoenix homeserver authentication system.</p>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The authentication system consists of the authentication services (AS’, one operated by each homeserver operator), which act as a trusted third party for their respective homeserver, and a validation module run on each client. We will go into more detail on how much users have to trust their AS <a href="spec/authentication_service/./security_guarantees.html#threat-model-and-security-guarantees">here</a>.</p>
<p>The AS of a homeserver issues client credentials for each of its users’ clients. The clients can then use the credentials to sign the leaf credentials used in each of their groups or in their pre-published MLS KeyPackages. The leaf credentials are then used to sign messages as per the MLS specification.</p>
<p>When a client receives a message from another client, it performs the following validation steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The signature on the message is valid w.r.t. the credential in the sender’s leaf.</li>
<li>The signature on the sender’s leaf is valid w.r.t. the sender’s client credential.</li>
<li>The signature on the sender’s client credential is valid w.r.t. one of the credentials published by the AS.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all signatures are indeed valid, the recipient can conclude that the message came from the user indicated by the user name in the sending client’s client ID.</p>
<p>Similarly, a joiner in a new group performs steps 2. and 3. to authenticate each member of the new group.</p>
<h3 id="out-of-band-validation"><a class="header" href="#out-of-band-validation">Out-of-band validation</a></h3>
<p>To ensure security even against a compromised AS, users can validate the client credentials of their contacts out-of-band. The validation process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice sends a hash of her current client credentials to Bob out-of-band</li>
<li>Bob hashes the credentials of Alice’s clients in their shared connection group and compares the result.</li>
<li>Bob compares the two hash values to see if his view of Alice’s composed user identity is correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process above ensures that Bob’s current view of Alice’s identity is correct. Note that users have to re-validate out-of-band if a user adds one or more clients.</p>
<h3 id="connection-groups-and-multi-client-identity"><a class="header" href="#connection-groups-and-multi-client-identity">Connection groups and multi-client identity</a></h3>
<p>As detailed <a href="spec/authentication_service/./connection_establishment.html">here</a>, users have a connection group with each of their contacts (but not necessarily with each user they are in a group with). The connection group acts as a reference for users w.r.t. what clients represent an individual contact. If a user is invited into a new group by one of its contacts, but the inviting client is not part of the corresponding connection group, the invited user must decline the invitation.</p>
<p>For this to work reliably, users have to first add new clients to all of their connection groups before adding them to any other groups. Similarly, users have to remove clients first from all other groups before removing them from their connection groups.</p>
<p>This requires some care in the add/remove process, where clients have to coordinate through the user’s all-client group s.t. there the addition and removal process is robust.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model-and-security-guarantees"><a class="header" href="#threat-model-and-security-guarantees">Threat model and security guarantees</a></h2>
<p>Generally, the threat model of end-to-end authentication is an adversary that controls everything but the users’ clients, which includes the network, as well as infrastructure components such as the homeserver. However, in this first version of the Phoenix homeserver authentication system, we rely on the AS to perform some security-critical operations. As a consequence, we examine two scenarios in this section: One in which the AS is not malicious/compromised and one where it is.</p>
<h3 id="security-under-an-honest-as"><a class="header" href="#security-under-an-honest-as">Security under an honest AS</a></h3>
<p>If the AS can be trusted to behave honestly, it will issue client credentials only to the user registered under the user name contained in the client ID. As a consequence, performing the verification steps outlined above will ensure that</p>
<ul>
<li>a given message originates from the specific client that signed the message,</li>
<li>the sending client is associated with the user name in the client ID and</li>
<li>that user is registered with the signing homeserver under the claimed user name.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-under-a-compromised-as"><a class="header" href="#security-under-a-compromised-as">Security under a compromised AS</a></h3>
<p>In case a homeserver (or the AS specifically) is compromised or its operator malicious, security guarantees are limited, as the AS can create its own credentials for arbitrary users. However, there are still some security guarantees that the authentication system (in conjunction with MLS) provides in that scenario.</p>
<p>If two users have a connection (that was established while the AS was honest), both users cannot be impersonated towards one another by the AS. This is ensured by users adding clients to their connection groups before all other groups, thus effectively performing cross-signatures that all of their contacts can verify.</p>
<p>The adversary can generally impersonate a user towards non-contacts by creating a fresh client credential with a client ID containing the user’s user name. With this credential, the adversary can create connection groups with any non-contact. Theoretically, the adversary can even impersonate a user towards non-contacts in groups that the user itself is already in. However, this requires the adversary to learn which group to target (since group membership is hidden from the homeserver). Additionally, after joining such a group, the adversary must effectively block the user from that group to avoid detection (although the block itself might alert the user to the attack).</p>

<p>The majority of endpoints of the DS allow clients to send MLS messages to groups.</p>
<h3 id="validation"><a class="header" href="#validation">Validation</a></h3>
<p>Whenever receiving an MLS message at any endpoint, the DS checks if a local group state with the message's GroupId exists. If it does, the DS locks the corresponding database entry to prevent concurrent access. The DS then takes the GroupStateEarKey that is part of every message delivery request and decrypts the group state. Finally, the DS performs the same validation steps a receiving MLS client would perform, as well as the endpoint-specific validation steps.</p>
<p>The MLS client checks also includes checking that the epoch numbers match. In the case of commits, this comparison along with the lock on the database entry ensure that any conflicts between commits for the same epoch are resolved.</p>

<p>Generally, the DS encrypts group state at rest, such that only a group ID and a time stamp are stored in plaintext.</p>

<h2 id="encryption-at-rest-ear"><a class="header" href="#encryption-at-rest-ear">Encryption at rest (EAR)</a></h2>
<p>With each group operation request, clients include the group's EAR key, which allows the DS to decrypt the group state, perform the group operation and re-encrypt the group state afterwards.</p>
<p>A group's EAR key is freshly sampled at the group's inception and is not rotated until the group is deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients send the key to the server for each operation</li>
<li>The key is used to encrypt the whole group state</li>
<li>The client creating the group samples the key freshly upon group creation</li>

<p>This scheme allows the simultaneous use of two secrets for decryption, such that two keys are always valid at a time. The use of two valid keys at a time allows the rotation of keys in a fixed interval.</p>
<ul>
<li>The keys used in this scheme are not directly used for encryption. Instead, they act as a base secret from which sender and receiver derive a key ID and the encryption/decryption key. When encrypting, the cipertext is tagged with the key ID.</li>
<li>A key also has a lifetime known to sender and receiver.</li>
<li>The sender derives from the base secret and encrypts the payload.</li>
<li>Before decryption, the recipient derives from the base secret and checks if the key ID matches the one the ciphertext is tagged with.</li>
<li>Once the key has reached its lifetime, the sender samples a new base key and encrypts a copy of it under the old base key.</li>
<li>From now on, the sender always uses the new base key for encryption and attaches the encrypted key to ciphertexts (in addition to the key ID)</li>

<p>Clients can provision their own encrypted <a href="spec/delivery_service/../authentication_service/credentials.html#intermediate-client-credentials">credential chain</a> on the DS. If a client provides broken values in this way, users that join the group can't authenticate the client or user, thus effectively breaking group joining. Since the state is encrypted and the DS can't (and shouldn't) learn the plaintext as to not fully identity the user or client, it cannot verify the validity of the encrypted credential chain.</p>
<p>However, other clients can detect broken credential chains of other clients and prove to the DS that an encrypted value is indeed invalid. With such a proof, the DS can allow the removal of the offending user, even if the reporting client is not a client of an admin user.</p>
<h2 id="broken-states-and-hidden-invalid-updates"><a class="header" href="#broken-states-and-hidden-invalid-updates">Broken states and hidden invalid updates</a></h2>
<p>As a general rule, if an Admin breaks the group state in such a way that the DS can't validate, but that all group members can detect, all group members must consider the group closed.</p>

<li>Clients can send a valid-looking commit (from the DS' point of view), where the update path includes invalid (encrypted) path secrets for one or more subtrees of the committer's direct path.

<p>One way of dealing with bad updates is to use franking and allow users prove to the DS that a given update to the group state was broken. The DS can then allow ordinary members to remove the member. Note that it's proabably a reasonable trade-off that the identity of the offender is revealed to the DS in the reporting process. However, revealing group secrets is not.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="queuing-service-qs-1"><a class="header" href="#queuing-service-qs-1">Queuing Service (QS)</a></h1>
<p>The main purpose of the queuing service is to store-and-forward messages delivered by the <a href="spec/./delivery_service.html">delivery service</a>, as well as the publication of KeyPackages. In this chapter we discuss the various concepts used by the QS to provide its functionalitites, as well as its individual endpoints.</p>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The store-and-forwards functionality of the QS is designed in such a way that the QS cannot link the state it maintains for each of the homeserver's users with the user's actual identity as maintained by the AS.</p>
<p>To avoid a connection with the user's actual identity, each user has a QS user record with a sub-record for each of the user's clients. The records are created by the user's clients when they register with the AS.</p>
<p>After creation, the user's clients can publish KeyPackages and fetch messages from their queue, as well as rotate the key material used for authentication, or for at-rest encryption of queued messages.</p>
<p>The QS user record also contains the user's <a href="spec/glossary.html#friendship-token">friendship token</a>, which the QS uses to authenticate requests for batches of the user's KeyPackages.</p>
<p>The client-specific records contain the client's fan-out queue (for messages received from a local or a federated DS), as well as the KeyPackages published by the client. See <a href="spec/queuing_service/keypackage_publication.html">here</a> for more information on KeyPackage publication and how unlinkability between a user's real identity and its pseudonym is maintained.</p>
<p>The fan-out queue in turn contains an optional push-token (encrypted at-rest under the owning client's <a href="spec/glossary.html#push">push-token encryption key</a>), as well as key material used for the <a href="spec/queuing_service/queue_encryption.html">queue's at-rest encryption</a>.</p>
<h2 id="qs-state"><a class="header" href="#qs-state">QS state</a></h2>
<p>The QS keeps the following state.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QS user records:</strong> Indexed by a <a href="spec/glossary.html#qs-user-id-qsuid">QsUid</a>, each record contains a number of sub fields.
<ul>
<li><strong>QS user record auth key:</strong> <a href="spec/glossary.html#qs-user-record-auth-key">Public signature key</a> used by a user to authenticate itself as the owner of this record.</li>
<li><strong>Friendship token:</strong> Clients have to provide the friendship token to obtain a bundle of KeyPackages for a given user.</li>
<li><strong>Client specific records:</strong> For each of the user's clients, the QS keeps the following state. Indexed by a <a href="spec/glossary.html#qs-client-id-qscid">QsCid</a>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Activity time:</strong> Timestamp indicating the last time a client has fetched messages from the queue.</li>
<li><strong>KeyPackages:</strong> Encrypted KeyPackages, each with an encrypted <a href="spec/./glossary.html#client-credential-chain">client credential chain</a> attached. At least one KeyPackage has to be marked as KeyPackage of last resort.</li>
<li><strong>Public QS client record key:</strong> <a href="spec/glossary.html#qs-client-record-auth-key">Public signature key</a>. Authenticates the owner of this QS client record and authorizes them to dequeue (i.e. fetch and delete) messages in the queue, as well as to change the queue configuration such as the authentication keys, or to add entries to the block list. Also authorizes the client to upload KeyPackages.</li>
<li><strong>Optional push token:</strong> The client's (optional) push token, stored encrypted at rest under the client's push token encryption key. Used by the QS to create a push notification for the client if a message is enqueued that includes the required encryption key.</li>
<li><strong>Fan-out queue:</strong> A fan-out queue with a number of further record fields attached.
<ul>
<li><strong>Queue encryption key material:</strong> Key material to perform <a href="spec/./queuing_service/queue_encryption.html">queue encryption</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Current sequence number:</strong> The current message sequence number.</li>
<li><strong>Queued messages:</strong> A sequence of ciphertexts containing the messages in the queue.

<li><strong>Blocklist salt:</strong> Salt that is used when hashing values for the <em>Group blocklist</em>. Generated randomly by the QS upon queue creation.</li>
<li><strong>Blocklist:</strong> List of salted group ID hashes that the QS should not accept messages from for this queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Queue ID authentication key:</strong> A symmetric key that the QS uses to MAC a queue ID. Clients have to include that MAC when they encrypt their queue ID under the Queue ID encryption key. The QS uses this key to validate queue IDs after encryption and before enqueuing a message.</li>
<li><strong>Queue ID encryption keypair:</strong> <a href="spec/glossary.html#queueconfig-encryption-key">A public/private HPKE keypair</a> that clients can encrypt their queue ID and queue id MAC under before providing it to a local or federated DS.</li>
<li><strong>QS signing key:</strong> <a href="spec/./glossary.html#qs-signing-key">A public/private signature keypair</a> that the QS uses to sign KeyPackage bundles before returning them upon request. Also used to sign messages when forwarding them from the local DS to a remote QS.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="queue-encryption"><a class="header" href="#queue-encryption">Queue encryption</a></h1>
<p>Messages in queues contain metadata such as epochs, group IDs and explicit changes to group states (although all based on pseudonymous identities). To protect this metadata against state-leakages, messages in queues are stored encrypted in such a way that only the client owning the queue can decrypt the messages.</p>
<p>Since state-leakage (i.e. state compromise) is the threat model, the encryption protocol provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security.</p>
<h2 id="key-ratcheting"><a class="header" href="#key-ratcheting">Key ratcheting</a></h2>
<p>Upon creation of a QS QS client record, the creator provides a <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#queue-encryption-key">queue encryption key</a> which the QS stores alongside the queue. The QS then samples a random string as the initial ratchet key, stores a copy and encrypts another copy under the queue encryption key. The resulting ciphertexts is enqueued like regular messages.</p>
<p>Whenever the QS enqueues a message, it first uses the ratchet key to derive two keys using distinct labels: The next ratchet key and a message encryption key. The message encryption key is used to encrypt the message before tagging it with the current sequence number (and advancing the currently stored sequence number) and enqueuing it. The next ratchet key is stored in place of the old ratchet key (which is deleted after use, along with the message encryption key). This process is repeated with every message to be enqueued.</p>
<p>The ratcheting of encryption keys (and the deletion of keys after use) provides forward secrecy.</p>
<p>The client fetching the queue for the first time first decrypts the ratchet key. For each message it fetches from the queue, the client follows the same derivation steps as the QS and decrypts the fetched messages.</p>
<h2 id="key-updates"><a class="header" href="#key-updates">Key updates</a></h2>
<p>To achieve post-compromise security, the ratchet keys must be periodically injected with fresh randomness. The frequency with which this happens can be configured via the <a href="spec/queuing_service/../queuing_service.html#qs-configuration-options">QS configuration options</a>. The injected randomness must be encrypted and sent to the owner of the QS QS client record, so the frequency with which the keys are rotated represents a balance between security and performance.</p>
<p>Whenever the ratchet key should be refreshed, the QS derives a rotation key from the current ratchet key. The QS then derives a new ratchet key from the rotation key and some fresh randomness. The QS then encrypts the injected randomness under the queue encryption key. The encrypted randomness is then tagged with the current sequence number and enqueued like a regular message. The new ratchet key then replaces the old ratchet key.</p>
<p>When dequeuing such an encrypted key update, the client decrypts the update and follows the same derivation steps as the QS to obtain the fresh ratchet key.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="friendship-tokens-and-keypackage-publication"><a class="header" href="#friendship-tokens-and-keypackage-publication">Friendship tokens and KeyPackage publication</a></h1>
<p>To prevent a homeserver from learning which groups a user is a member of, the user's information on the QS and DS are pseudonymous. However, other users must be able to authenticate the user when one of the user's clients joins a group. This would typically happen through the Credential in a client's KeyPackage. However, since the KeyPackages are published on the QS and the public trees to which the KeyPackages are added are observable by the DS.</p>
<p>The goal of this mechanism is thus to protect the unlinkability between the user's pseudonymous identity (i.e. the QS user record and the user's user and client profiles on the local DS) and the user's actual identity against a malicious homeserver.</p>
<p>The mechanism outlined in this section does not protect against the use of traffic pattern analysis. However, it can be used in conjunction with an onion routing system or a mixnet.</p>
<h2 id="friendship-keys-and-credential-encryption"><a class="header" href="#friendship-keys-and-credential-encryption">Friendship keys and credential encryption</a></h2>
<p>When establishing a <a href="spec/queuing_service/../authentication_service/connection_establishment.html">connection with another user</a>, the users exchange <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#friendship-keys">friendship keys</a>. This set of keys includes a friendship encryption key and a friendship token. Both keys are used in the context of KeyPackage publishing.</p>
<p>Possession of a friendship token authorizes a client to add the original owner of the token to a group. Once added to a group, all group members must be able to authenticate the newly added user and its clients.</p>
<p>However, the QS that stores the published KeyPackages that facilitate group member additions must not learn the user's identity. Thus, KeyPackages are always published as <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#addpackage">AddPackages</a>, where the KeyPackage only contains a pseudonymous <a href="spec/queuing_service/../authentication_service/credentials.html#leaf-credentials">Leaf Credential</a> and the <a href="spec/queuing_service/../authentication_service/credentials.html#intermediate-client-credentials">intermediate client credential</a> that links the pseudonymous credential with the client's <a href="spec/queuing_service/../authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credentials">Client Credential</a> is encrypted under the friendship encryption key.</p>
<p>After retrieving such a AddPackage (as part of a <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#user-keypackage-batch">KeyPackageBatch</a>), the adding client first decrypts the encrypted intermediate client credential and verifies that the <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#client-credential-chain">credential chain</a> is correct. If this is the case, the client re-encrypts the intermediate client credential under the target group's <a href="spec/queuing_service/../delivery_service/group_state_encryption.html">credential encryption key</a> before performing the actual addition.</p>
<p>Members of the group can now decrypt the intermediate client credential and authenticate the user.</p>
<p>Note that neither DS nor QS are in possession of either the friendship encryption key or the credential encryption key. Both QS and DS store the intermediate client credential exclusively as ciphertexts.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-attribution"><a class="header" href="#welcome-attribution">Welcome attribution</a></h2>
<p>The friendship encryption key is also used to allow the recipient of a Welcome message to quickly authenticate the sender while hiding the sender's identity from the DS and QS involved.</p>
<p>In particular, instead of a plain MLS Welcome message, new joiners receive a <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#welcomebundle">WelcomeBundle</a>, which (along with the Welcome and some other data) contains a <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#welcome-attribution-info">WelcomeAttributionInfo</a>. The WelcomeAttributionInfo in turn contains the senders <a href="spec/queuing_service/../glossary.html#client-id-cid">client ID</a> and is signed by the sender's <a href="spec/queuing_service/../authentication_service/credentials.html#client-credentials">Client Credential</a>. The recipient of the WelcomeBundle can thus identify and authenticate the sender without retrieving the group's public tree first.</p>
<p>However, to avoid accumulation of metadata, the sender's identity must be hidden from both DS and QS. This is achieved by encrypting the WelcomeAttributionInfo in the WelcomeBundle using the recipient's friendship encryption key.</p>
<h2 id="friendship-token-rotation"><a class="header" href="#friendship-token-rotation">Friendship token rotation</a></h2>
<p>A user must rotate its friendship token when removing the connection with another user. The token is rotated by sampling a fresh, random token and replacing the old token on the QS. After replacing the token on the QS, the user must broadcast the new token to the rest of its own clients, as well as all users with which the user wishes to keep a connection.</p>
<h3 id="future-work-friendship-encryption-key-rotation"><a class="header" href="#future-work-friendship-encryption-key-rotation">Future work: Friendship encryption key rotation</a></h3>
<p>It should also be possible to rotate the friendship encryption key.</p>
<p>Rotating the friendship encryption key can lead to annoying race conditions (e.g. a Welcome sent shortly before the key was rotated). If we want to rotate it, we could use key ids (see <a href="spec/queuing_service/./delivery_service/group_state_encryption.html">here</a>) and a grace period before an old key is not accepted anymore.</p>
<h3 id="future-work-replace-the-friendship-token"><a class="header" href="#future-work-replace-the-friendship-token">Future work: Replace the friendship token</a></h3>
<p>It is conceivable that the frienship token can be replaced with a better mechanism that allows for easier rotation. It is conceivable that puncturable signatures or blocklistable anonymous credentials could be useful here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="federation"><a class="header" href="#federation">Federation</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes how the Phoenix homeserver protocol enables federation
between different homeservers.</p>
<p>The <a href="spec/./federation/use_cases_and_threat_model.html">first section</a> discusses
federation use-cases, the federation functionality provided by the homeserver,
as well as the threat model of the federation protocol.</p>
<p>The <a href="spec/./federation/federation_protocol.html">second section</a> describes how the
federation protocol is implemented by the individual homeserver components.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="federation-use-cases"><a class="header" href="#federation-use-cases">Federation use cases</a></h1>
<p>A federated messaging architecture is different from a centralized one in a number of ways. Here, we list a number of use-cases where a federated architecture is advantageous.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is an organisation that wants more control over the operational aspects of secure messaging. An organisation that runs its own homeserver controls where the homeserver is hosted (e.g. in a jurisdiction or a geopolitical context of its choice), who can and can’t register or indeed use the service (e.g. only members of the organisation) or what other homeservers it wants to federate with (ruling out e.g. known sources of spam and abusive content).</p>
<p>In the context of consumer messaging, users have the option to choose which messaging provider in a given federation they sign up with and they have the option to switch the provider without (necessarily) losing access to the overall messaging network. This is especially important as large messaging providers tend to be driven by motivations other than the freedom of their users. Users also have the option of running their own homeserver, gaining the advantages listed above.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, a federated architecture is more resilient in a number of ways. If a net-split happens (e.g. due to an internet shutdown by an authoritative government), local providers can continue to operate autonomously and homeserver instances on each side of the net-split can continue to federate. Similarly, a federated messaging system is harder to censor than a single messaging provider. On the one hand that is simply because there are more instances to block. On the other hand, new instances can be spun up if required and users can move to unblocked instances if they are affected by the block.</p>
<h1 id="federation-functionality"><a class="header" href="#federation-functionality">Federation functionality</a></h1>
<p>The federation part of the Phoenix homeserver protocol can be split into four parts: Homeserver discovery, authentication key distribution, user discovery and connection establishment, and message distribution.</p>
<h3 id="homeserver-domain-and-discovery"><a class="header" href="#homeserver-domain-and-discovery">Homeserver domain and discovery</a></h3>
<p>Each homeserver has a homeserver domain associated with it. The domains determines how the individual components (AS, DS, QS) of the homeserver are discovered by other homeservers and it is also the domain that appears in the user IDs of the homeservers users in a federated context.</p>
<p>For the PoC-Phase, discovery is simple, as each homeserver is expected to be reachable at a fixed subdomain under the its homeserver domain: If the homeserver domain is <code>example.com</code>, the homeserver’s AS is reachable under <code>as.example.com</code>, the DS under <code>ds.example.com</code>, etc. For authorization reasons and to allow more flexible deployments, this will later be changed to involve a lookup at the <code>.well-known</code> of the homeserver domain.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-key-distribution"><a class="header" href="#authentication-key-distribution">Authentication key distribution</a></h3>
<p>At their respective domains, the each part of the homeserver provides an endpoint for federated homeservers (and clients) to retrieve their key material. The QS and DS provide endpoints to retrieve their respective verification keys and the AS provides an endpoint to retrieve the AS root and intermediate credentials, as well as associated revocation information. This key material can then be used to authenticate incoming messages and KeyPackageBatches (QS), remove proposals in the context of MLS groups (DS) or client credentials (AS). All queries to key discovery endpoints must be sent through TLS-secured channels to ensure that homeserver authentication is tied to the local web root of trust of the caller.</p>
<h3 id="user-discovery-and-connection-management"><a class="header" href="#user-discovery-and-connection-management">User discovery and connection management</a></h3>
<p>Homeservers must allow federated homeservers to discover local users to facilitate connection establishment across homeservers. This involves endpoints on the AS to retrieve connection establishment KeyPackages and one to deliver <code>ConnectionEstablishmentPackages</code> for a given user.</p>
<h3 id="message-distribution-1"><a class="header" href="#message-distribution-1">Message distribution</a></h3>
<p>Both QS and DS provide endpoints required for federated message distribution. The DS makes all of its endpoints publicly available safe for the <code>CreateGroup</code> and the <code>RequestGroupId</code> endpoints, as we only allow local clients to create groups on a given DS. The QS on the other hand only provides the <code>FederatedEnqueueMessage</code> endpoint for federated homeservers.</p>
<h1 id="federation-threat-model"><a class="header" href="#federation-threat-model">Federation threat model</a></h1>
<p>In this section we define the threat model for homeserver federation on the delivery protocol layer. This means in particular that we don’t consider threats such as fraud and abuse that require mitigations on higher layers.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this threat model, we consider a homeserver that allows registration of anonymous users, which is in contrast to, say, an organisation that only allows user registration by its members. We also don’t consider a restricted federation, where federation is only enabled between trusted homeservers. Note that this lack of trust in both users and federated homeservers only strengthens our threat model.</p>
<p>The lack of trust in local users means that we don’t consider fraud and abuse by remote users as part of our federated threat model, since the countermeasures and mitigation techniques are largely the same as for fraud and abuse between local users. The exception being that a high level of reported incidents originating from users of a specific remote backend may lead to a complete blockage of that backend, which our federation protocol does enable.</p>
<h2 id="actors"><a class="header" href="#actors">Actors</a></h2>
<p>In our threat model we distinguish between the following actors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users: Individuals that have registered with the local homeserver and that operate one or more clients. Local users are not trusted and can behave either honestly or represent an attacker.</li>
<li>Operator: The operator of the local homeserver, which is trusted in the context of this threat model.</li>
<li>Remote Users: Users of a remote homeserver that the local homeserver federates with. Remote users may act as attackers even if their local homeserver operator is honest.</li>
<li>Remote Operators: Operators of remote homeservers that the local homeserver federates with. As noted above, remote homeserver operators may be honest, but are not trusted in the context of this threat model. A remote homeserver operator may either be malicious and register a large number of users itself, or negligent such that a lack of user registration leads to another actor registering a large number of malicious users. Either way, this threat model assumes that there is no restriction on the registration of malicious users on a remote homeserver.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assets"><a class="header" href="#assets">Assets</a></h2>
<p>This threat model considers the following assets of (local) users and the (local) homeserver operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>User assets
<ul>
<li>Attention: Any unwanted message that gathers the user’s attention (e.g. a push notification or just a message in the user’s inbox) can be an attack. Since basic homeserver functionality requires that it facilitates connection establishments between (otherwise unconnected) users, attacks on this asset exist on a spectrum. The homeserver won’t be able to prevent individual (unwanted) connections from reaching the user, but it may be able to limit the amount of such attacks.</li>
<li>Client resources: Since we consider the local resources of user clients to be limited, for example, because the client has limited computational power, or because it runs on battery, any action that causes an undue amount of resource consumption on a user’s device is considered an attack. As with attention, this threat exists on a curve and complete mitigation will not be possible.</li>
<li>Availability: Essentially an extreme instance of an attack on a client’s resources, we consider actions affecting the availability of a client as an attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Operator
<ul>
<li>Availability: Actions by other actors that cause the disruption of the services provided by the local backend are considered attacks, both with regard to services provided to local users and services that enable federation.</li>
<li>Hosting resources/costs: This threat models considers an attack any action that leads to an undue consumption of resources (compute, bandwidth, storage) of the local homeserver. Even if availability isn’t affected, depending on the severity of the attack, excessive resource consumption can be expensive for the local operator.</li>
<li>Indirect attacks: If an actor manages to use the local homeserver to attack other targets (that don’t have to be part of the messaging infrastructure), this is considered an attack. For example, a remote user or homeserver operator could try to use the homeserver’s federation service in a DoS reflection attack. Or a local user could try to mount an attack on a remote homeserver through its own local homeserver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threats"><a class="header" href="#threats">Threats</a></h2>
<p>Threats in the context of the Phoenix homeserver federation protocol fall into the categories Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Spam. Both categories also arise in the non-federated architecture, but become more nuanced in the federated case due to the increased number of potential parties involved. Other attacks such as fraud and abuse are of course also relevant in the federated context. However, since they are largely defined through the content of messages (as opposed to the transmission of a message), their prevention, detection and reaction has to take place on another layer of the messaging stack (although blocklisting a federated homeserver might be part of a mitigation technique).</p>
<h3 id="dos-attacks"><a class="header" href="#dos-attacks">DoS Attacks</a></h3>
<p>DoS attacks in the federated context arise from the possibility of one actor flooding another actor with a large amount of messages. For example, a remote user could send a large amount of malformed messages to another user. The messages might not be enough to sufficiently stress the attacker’s or the victim’s homeservers, but since clients are typically have much fewer resources (e.g. in terms of compute), the victim’s client might be overwhelmed by the large amount of incoming messages. Even if victim’s client recognizes that the messages are malformed and won’t show them to the user, the validation process might tax the client’s resources to the point where it affects the client’s battery life, or even it’s availability to the user.</p>
<p>Another example for a DoS attack is one where a malicious user causes a remote homeserver to take anti-spam or anti-DoS mitigation measures. For example, because the user has managed to send a large amount of messages to the remote homeserver via the attacker’s local homeserver, thus forcing the remote homeserver to block the user’s homeserver from relaying further messages. The attacker thus prevents all other local user from interacting with users on the remote homeserver.</p>
<h3 id="spam"><a class="header" href="#spam">Spam</a></h3>
<p>While individual messages might be considered “Spam”, in the context of the federation protocol, spam is considered a number of messages that might not be enough to be considered a DoS attack, but that (in one way or another) captures the user’s attention. For example, a small number of messages that does not significantly affect the client’s resources, but that ends up on the user’s screen, distracting them from non-spam messages. Or a small number of messages that might not be well-formed enough to pass through the validation checks of the victim’s client, but that make the victim’s homeserver send a push notification that leads to the device actually notifying the user, thus unnecessarily catching the victim’s attention.</p>
<h1 id="mitigation-techniques"><a class="header" href="#mitigation-techniques">Mitigation techniques</a></h1>
<p>The following presents on overview over the techniques used by the Phoenix homeserver protocol to mitigate DoS and Spam attacks, beginning with the mitigation measures against DoS and Spam attacks in the context of interaction with local clients, followed by those for the federated context.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-pass-tokens"><a class="header" href="#privacy-pass-tokens">Privacy Pass tokens</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-privacypass-protocol/">Privacy pass</a> (PP) is a protocol currently under standardization by the Privacy Pass working group at the IETF. Generally speaking, it allows one entity (the token issuer) to issue tokens upon request. Another entity can then require the redemption of such a token, e.g. when it serves a request. The Privacy Pass protocol is special in that the redeemed token can be validated, but not otherwise linked to the entity originally requesting the token.</p>
<h3 id="using-pp-tokens-for-dos-and-spam-mitigation"><a class="header" href="#using-pp-tokens-for-dos-and-spam-mitigation">Using PP tokens for DoS and Spam mitigation</a></h3>
<p>The Phoenix homeserver protocol uses PP for DoS and Spam mitigation while allowing clients to remain anonymous (at least to a certain degree) when interacting with endpoints that bear DoS or Spam potential. More concretely, clients can authenticate to the AS and request a number of tokens. The AS then keeps track of which client (or user) was issued how many tokens and can enforce a limit on the tokens issued per entity and/or in general. Any Homeserver endpoint that bears DoS or Spam potential can then require the calling client to present a token for each individual request. The number of tokens a client has thus limits the amount of requests it can make.</p>
<p>While token redemption has a certain computational overhead, it is comparable with the termination of a TLS connection and has the advantage of being scalable independently from other homeserver operations.</p>
<h3 id="hoarding-attacks"><a class="header" href="#hoarding-attacks">Hoarding Attacks</a></h3>
<p>The token scheme described above has the inherent risk of a hoarding attack, where one or more users frequently request tokens up to their allowed maximum and at some point spend them all at once to maximize the number of queries in a small amount of time. This risk can be mitigated at least partially by rotating the key material used in the token issuance and validation process. After keys have been rotated, all previously issued tokens become invalid and the attacker(s) have to start hoarding anew. Another mitigation measure for hoarding attack is traditional, IP-based rate-limiting, thus forcing the hoarding attacker to split its attack among sufficiently many IP addresses (or address spaces) to evade the rate-limiting measures.</p>
<h3 id="mitigating-sybil-attacks"><a class="header" href="#mitigating-sybil-attacks">Mitigating Sybil-Attacks</a></h3>
<p>Token based spam and DoS attack mitigation is largely reliant on the fact that it is infeasible for the attacker to register a large number of users, which in turn would allow it to request (and then use) a large number of tokens. A variety of measures can be taken to limit user registration such as Proof-of-Work (in the assumption that an attacker has limited computational resources) or Proof-of-Personhood, such as Captchas, or (to some degree) <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-private-web-attestation-with-cross-multi-vendor-hardware/">hardware attestation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="token-based-mitigation-in-the-federated-case"><a class="header" href="#token-based-mitigation-in-the-federated-case">Token-based mitigation in the federated case</a></h2>
<p>The Phoenix homeserver protocol uses token-based rate-limiting to prevent spam and DoS attacks in the federated case in the same way as the local case, where clients can request tokens from a federated homeserver, which they can then redeem when interacting with the remote DS. The only difference is in the way that remote clients authenticated with the local AS when they request tokens and in the way that the local AS rate-limits token issuance to individual clients.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-of-remote-clients"><a class="header" href="#authentication-of-remote-clients">Authentication of remote clients</a></h3>
<p>The protocol itself is the same for remote and for local clients in that both authenticate using their client credentials. The AS then verifies the signature on their client credentials. For local clients, the AS can use its own intermediate credentials to validate the signature. For remote clients, the local AS might lack the key material to authenticate the client credential. In that case, the local AS first fetches the key material (root credential, intermediate credentials, as well as revocation information) from the corresponding endpoint of the remote AS and then verifies the signature on the remote client’s credential.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting-of-remote-clients"><a class="header" href="#rate-limiting-of-remote-clients">Rate-limiting of remote clients</a></h3>
<p>Both for local and remote clients, the local AS keeps a record of how many tokens an individual client has been issued. For local clients, that is enough, since the local AS can control the rate with which new clients register and prevent Sybil attacks as described above. However, with the AS has no control over registration of remote clients and in case of a negligent or even malicious remote AS, a large amount of remote clients could each request tokens up to their limit to then flood the local DS with requests to either perform a DoS or a spam attack. The local AS thus has to rate-limit not just per-client, but also per remote homeserver (domain). An attacker could then only register a limited amount of clients per domain that they control. Naturally, this assumes that any adversary only controls a limited amount of domains. To mitigate the scenario where an adversary controls a large number of domains, the local AS could keep the limit for new domains low and only increase it slowly to at least prevent a sudden influx of remote clients.</p>
<h2 id="group-pseudonym-based-rate-limiting"><a class="header" href="#group-pseudonym-based-rate-limiting">(Group-)Pseudonym-based rate-limiting</a></h2>
<p>In addition to client-based and domain-based token rate-limiting the DS that redeems the tokens can additionally impose per-group rate-limiting measures based on individual group pseudonyms, thus limiting the amount of impact an attacker can have by sending messages to a single group.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="federation-protocol"><a class="header" href="#federation-protocol">Federation Protocol</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="spec/federation/./use_cases_and_threat_model.html#federation-functionality">federation functionality</a> of the Phoenix homeserver protocol allows users to communicate across homeserver instances. Federated communication requires a small addition to the Phoenix homeserver protocol, as well as slight modifications to the client-server parts of the protocol.</p>
<h2 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The federation functionality includes the following types of interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client to remote DS: Allows clients to send messages (and generally act as members of) groups on DS’ that are not their own, or fetch the remote DS’ authentication key material.</li>
<li>DS to remote QS (via the DS’ local QS): Allows a DS to distribute messages to clients that don’t have their queue on the local QS, or fetch the remote QS’ authentication key material.</li>
<li>Client to remote AS: Allows clients to fetch tokens which in turn allows them to interact with the DS of the remote homeserver, or fetch the remote AS’ authentication key material.</li>
<li>As to remote AS: Allows the AS to fetch the authentication key material of the remote AS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of the interactions listed above are exactly the same as when the equivalent local parties communicate. The following details the points where the interactions are different, as well as an additional protocol for QS-to-QS communication.</p>
<h2 id="qs-to-qs-communication"><a class="header" href="#qs-to-qs-communication">QS-to-QS communication</a></h2>
<p>The QS has a <a href="spec/federation/./../queuing_service.html#federated-qs-to-qs-communication">separate endpoint</a> for federated communication that allows a remote QS to deliver messages to a local client. The payload delivered to this endpoint is the same as that of a local DS distributing messages to its local QS.</p>
<p>However, the sending QS frames that payload with an additional authentication frame as defined in the description of the endpoint linked above.</p>
<h2 id="client-to-remote-as-communication"><a class="header" href="#client-to-remote-as-communication">Client to remote AS communication</a></h2>
<p>Clients can request tokens from a remote AS via the <a href="spec/federation/../authentication_service.html#token-issuance">appropriate endpoint</a> for redemption at the DS of the same remote homeserver. The protocol on the wire is exactly the same as for a local client requesting tokens from their own local AS. However, for authentication, the remote AS might have to fetch the authentication key material of the sending client’s AS (which it can do just like local clients of that AS) s.t. it can authenticate the request. It can then rate-limit the request both on a per-client basis, as well on the basis of the homeserver the client originates from.</p>

<p>This chapter contains ideas and plans that have not yet made it into the specification.</p>
<h2 id="non-pseudonymous-homeservergroups"><a class="header" href="#non-pseudonymous-homeservergroups">Non-pseudonymous homeserver/groups</a></h2>
<p>It could be advantageous to have groups where the homeserver can identify individual members. This would be an option that could either be turned on or off on a homeserver or on a per-group basis. A variety of mechanisms would have to be adjusted for non-pseudonymous groups. It's also a question we want interoperability between pseudonymous and non-pseudonymous homeservers.</p>
<h2 id="plaintext-queue-configs"><a class="header" href="#plaintext-queue-configs">Plaintext queue configs</a></h2>
<p>Currently, all queue configs are <a href="spec/glossary.html#sealed-queue-config">sealed</a>. This is measure to protect metadata is unnecessary in the case the DS and the client's QS are part of the same homeserver. As a result, it should be possible to store the queue config as plaintext in such an instance.</p>
<h2 id="improved-spam-management-for-fan-out-queues"><a class="header" href="#improved-spam-management-for-fan-out-queues">Improved spam management for fan-out queues</a></h2>
<p>Friends of a user can currently invite the user's clients to large, very active groups and thus create a large influx of messages for the user's clients. This can be used to spam the user and there is currently no mitigation other than the use of privacy pass tokens. It would be good to allow the QS to categorize incoming messages into SPAM/HAM messages, where in the background, clients only download HAM messages and wait until the application is in the foreground to retrieve SPAM messages as well. This would also allow other UX modes, where the user has to first actively accept joining a group before the client downloads the corresponding SPAM messages.</p>
<h2 id="tighter-authentication"><a class="header" href="#tighter-authentication">Tighter authentication</a></h2>
<p>The AuthTokens required for client-side authentication by QS and DS prove that the client owns a signature key and are bound losely to the context in which they are used. However, having the signature cover the whole request would provide a tighter bind between authentication and context. One drawback is that we either have to re-serialize the request to sign/verify, or that we have to fix the general request serialization scheme to a deterministic one that accommodates signatures.</p>
<h2 id="re-initialization-of-groups"><a class="header" href="#re-initialization-of-groups">Re-initialization of groups</a></h2>
<p>MLS allows the re-initialization of groups to change ciphersuite or to update the MLS version. We definitely need this sooner or later.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-versioning"><a class="header" href="#protocol-versioning">Protocol versioning</a></h2>
<p>All messages of the homeserver protocol should contain a version number to allow clients and servers to process messages with the right versions. The versions of the protocol supported by a given client should be present in the client's KeyPackage and the version supported by the homeserver should be published in it's .well-known (or similar).</p>
<h2 id="ciphersuite-agility"><a class="header" href="#ciphersuite-agility">Ciphersuite agility</a></h2>
<p>It might be interesting to support ciphersuite agility in a similar way as MLS. An alternative would be to tie the ciphersuites to protocol versions.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="authentication-in-messaging-applications"><a class="header" href="#authentication-in-messaging-applications">Authentication in messaging applications</a></h1>
<p>All of the commonly used messaging applications aim to provide authentication as one of their primary security guarantees. The goal is that recipients of a given message can authenticate the sender based on (public) cryptographic key material which we call the sender’s <em>cryptographic identity</em> (for brevity sometimes just <em>identity</em>). The cryptographic identity is typically a signature public key or a public key that can be used in an authenticated key exchange. The holder of the corresponding private key material is the owner of the cryptographic identity.</p>
<p>The recipient can use the cryptographic identity of the sender to either authenticate individual messages (e.g. verifying the sender’s signature on an incoming message using the sender’s public signature key) or to establish an authenticated channel to the sender by way of an initial, authenticated key agreement (e.g. a Diffie-Hellman (DH) style key exchange involving the DH public key of both parties). In both cases, the recipient relies on the fact that the cryptographic identity it uses on for authentication is indeed owned by whom the recipient thinks the sender of the message is.</p>
<p>This leads to the question of how the sender and receiver can ensure (or at least increase their confidence) that the cryptographic identity each has of its peer is correct.</p>
<p>The problem is typically solved by the sender and receiver using a trusted channel to either exchange cryptographic identities or verify them later.</p>
<h2 id="meddler-in-the-middle-mitm-attacks"><a class="header" href="#meddler-in-the-middle-mitm-attacks">Meddler-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks</a></h2>
<p>In both cases, the threat is that an adversary, often called a meddler-in-the-middle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">sits between sender and receiver</a> and controls the channel they use to exchange messages. When the sender and receiver exchange their respective cryptographic identities, the adversary replaces them with ones that it controls. After such an attack, the adversary can impersonate one victim towards the other, as long as sender and receiver use a channel for communication that the adversary controls.</p>
<h2 id="contents"><a class="header" href="#contents">Contents</a></h2>
<p>In the first part of this chapter, we examine existing authentication concepts and techniques. In the second part, we provide a list of existing messaging applications, each with its corresponding approach to authentication. Finally, we provide a brief comparison and overview over the individual applications.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="concepts-and-security-properties"><a class="header" href="#concepts-and-security-properties">Concepts and security properties</a></h1>
<p>There are many methods for the the recipient to ensure (or gain confidence in the fact) that the cryptographic identity it uses to authenticate the sender of a message corresponds to the private key material held by the original sender.</p>
<p>Some of these methods rely on the properties of the channel used to <strong>exchange</strong> the identities and some on additional ways of <strong>verifying</strong> identities after they were exchanged through a channel with limited trust.</p>
<p>The approaches are not mutually exclusive. Typically messaging systems use at least two of the approaches detailed below.</p>
<h2 id="trust-on-first-use-tofu"><a class="header" href="#trust-on-first-use-tofu">Trust on first use (TOFU)</a></h2>
<p>As the name implies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use">trust on first use</a> means that the receiver trusts the cryptographic identity of the sender upon initial reception, regardless of the transportation channel.</p>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary either controls the channel, but is passive (can observe, but not tamper with traffic) at the time the exchange happens, or controls the general communication channel, but not the one used to exchange identities.</p>
<h2 id="trusted-third-party-exchange"><a class="header" href="#trusted-third-party-exchange">Trusted third party (exchange)</a></h2>
<p>A typical scenario in the messaging world is where the receiver trusts the cryptographic identity of the sender because it received the identity from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_third_party">trusted third party</a> (TTP). This approach only works if there is a designated trusted third party that all participants of the messaging system are either provisioned with in some way or have an authenticated way of retrieving. Typically, TTPs are no regular participants in the messaging system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The receiver could obtain the sender’s identity from the provider of the messaging service, as long as the cryptographic identity of the messaging service itself was provisioned upon downloading and installing the app.</li>
<li>The receiver could obtain the sender’s identity from the sender’s identity provider, as long as it has some way of discovering the address and cryptographic identity of said provider through an authenticated channel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary actively controls the network, but not the trusted third party. The adversary also can’t interfere with the provisioning process.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-band-verification"><a class="header" href="#out-of-band-verification">Out-of-band verification</a></h2>
<p>To establish trust in the validity of the cryptographic identities of the sender, the recipient party can verify via an <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/out-band-verification">out-of-band (OOB) channel</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sender and receiver could meet in the real world and verify their respective cryptographic identities by comparing public keys on their screens, or by scanning a QR code. Note, that this scenario requires both parties to trust their hard- and software (e.g. display drivers) to show the right public key or QR code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary controls the network and in particular the channel (or the third party) used to exchange the identities, but does not control the channel used to verify them.</p>
<h2 id="delegated-verification"><a class="header" href="#delegated-verification">Delegated verification</a></h2>
<p>Instead of performing the verification itself, the receiver can also decide to trust another party to verify the sender’s identity for them. There are several variants of this scenario, although they are all based on the principle of delegated verification or delegated trust.</p>
<h3 id="trusted-third-party-verification"><a class="header" href="#trusted-third-party-verification">Trusted third party (verification)</a></h3>
<p>Similar to the use of TTPs as an authenticated channel to exchange identities, a TTP can also be used to verify a cryptographic identity. As with the use of a TTP for the exchange of identities, the cryptographic identity of the TTP has to be known to all users for this approach to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people use their homepages or social media profiles to publish a fingerprint of their cryptographic identity in one or more messaging apps. As long as the receiver can establish an authenticated channel to the TTP hosting the fingerprint, it can verify the identity.</li>
<li>In the context of the WebPKI, when connecting to a web server via HTTPS, the server sends its certificate and provides a certificate chain from the server certificate to a WebPKI root of trust. The client can now verify the chain up to the root of trust. The certificate authorities that sign server certificates in the root of trust thus act as TTPs for verification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary controls the network and in particular the channel (or the third party) used to exchange the identities, but not the third party that facilitates the verification.</p>
<h3 id="cross-signing-1"><a class="header" href="#cross-signing-1">Cross-signing</a></h3>
<p>Cross-signing is similar to the use of a TTP for verification, except that the parties that cross-sign a cryptographic identity are regular participants of the messaging system. Cross-signing is often used in addition to other authentication mechanisms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-signing is commonly used if a party has multiple clients, each with its own cryptographic identity. In this case, the cryptographic identity of a new client can be cross-signed by an existing one, allowing other parties that have already verified the identity of the cross-signer to also trust in the new client.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary controls the network, but does not control the party cross-signing the cryptographic identity in question. The adversary also cannot compromise parties that are trusted to cross-sign.</p>
<h3 id="web-of-trust"><a class="header" href="#web-of-trust">Web of trust</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a> is a special case of cross-signing, where any party can cross-sign the cryptographic identity of any other party and publish its cross-signature in a publicly accessible directory. A party judging the trustworthiness of a cryptographic identity can base its decision on the quantity and quality of cross-signatures for a given identity, where the quality of the signature is equivalent to the amount of trust placed in the cross-signer.</p>
<p>While other verification approaches have a clear condition under which the receiver will trust the veracity of a sender’s cryptographic identity, this is not necessarily the case with the web of trust. Here, the receiver has to decide to which degree it trusts a certain cryptographic identity depending on who signed a sender’s identity and how much the receiver trust the signers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The web of trust is used in PGP, where parties can upload their signature over other cryptographic identities to a well-known set of public key servers. The receiver can download the sender’s public key and check who has cross-signed it. If the receiver concludes that enough people have signed whom it trusts (and the public keys of whom it has already verified), the receiver can use the sender’s public key for authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The verifier has several parties that it trusts to verify other cryptographic identities for them and the identity of which the verifier has indeed verified. The adversary cannot compromise enough trusted parties to pass the threshold required for the verifier to trust that a cryptographic identity is valid.</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-data-structures"><a class="header" href="#verifiable-data-structures">Verifiable data structures</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://transparency.dev/verifiable-data-structures/">Verifiable data structures</a> cannot prevent MITM attacks entirely, but make them harder for an adversary to perform without detection.</p>
<p>A TTP (or any other party that either publishes cryptographic identities or provides delegated verification) can record its actions (either publication or verification of a cryptographic identity) in a verifiable data structure. The data structure allows the TTP to prove to other parties that its records are consistent (i.e. that past records were not altered or deleted) and that individual entries are indeed part of the data structure (proof of inclusion of a given record). The TTP can then regularly publish a <em>view</em> of its current records in which an inclusion proof holds. Consistency is then guaranteed by providing proofs that a view is the successor of previous view.</p>
<p>Parties can now check that their own identity is correct in the view that the TTP presents to them.</p>
<p>Also two communicating parties can include the view they received from the TTP in their messages. If two views differ (and one is not a successor of the other), it is a sign that the TTP has tampered with its records and shown different records to the two parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificate authorities (CAs) in the WebPKI can (and are sometimes required to) use Certificate Transparency to publish the server certificates they sign. Clients can demand from servers to prove that its certificate has been published in the Certificate Transparency log. If a (CA-signed) certificate is used to conduct a MITM attack, there is proof that the CA has either accidentally or intentionally helped facilitate the attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary can compromise the TTP and actively impersonate a party towards a victim by claiming that one of their own identities is the genuine identity of the victim. However, it will have to show different views to the impersonated party and the victim. If parties exchange their views of the TTP with one-another, the adversary has to decide which party to show which view to avoid detection. If two parties exchange differing views, the adversary is caught.</p>
<h2 id="verification-question"><a class="header" href="#verification-question">Verification question</a></h2>
<p>Similar to an OOB channel, the sender and receiver can use shared information to help gain trust in one another’s cryptographic identity. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1314333.1314340">An adaptation of the socialist millionaire problem</a> allows one party to ask a question and provide the expected answer. The other party learns the question and provides its answer. The protocol then allows the parties to learn both if their replies and their shared cryptographic identities match without leaking their specific answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol allows for authentication via a verification question as described above to verify cryptographic identities. The initiating user is asked to provide a question and corresponding answer. The responder is then shown the question and also prompted for an answer. If the answers match, the identities are considered verified.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat model:</strong> The adversary can control the network completely, as long as it doesn’t know the answer to the question.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="comparison-of-existing-applications"><a class="header" href="#comparison-of-existing-applications">Comparison of existing applications</a></h1>
<p>Different messaging applications make use of one or more of the authentication approaches, sometimes with small variations to the general concepts described above.</p>
<h2 id="multi-client-or-composed-user-identities"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-or-composed-user-identities">Multi-client or composed user identities</a></h2>
<p>Messaging applications often allow the use of multiple clients (e.g. on different devices) by a single user. However, users typically authenticate other users rather than individual clients. The applications thus have to compose individual client identities into user identities.</p>
<p>Compared to simple, single-client user identities, composed user identities pose additional challenges.</p>
<h3 id="ghost-clients"><a class="header" href="#ghost-clients">Ghost clients</a></h3>
<p>In many cases the messaging provider informs other users if a new client is added for a given user. A compromised or malicious provider can thus insert one of its own clients into the conversation without the target user noticing. Techniques like cross-signing can prevent such an attack, since any client additions have to be performed by one of the user's existing clients. Alternatively, <a href="authentication_systems/authentication_systems.html#identity-gossiping">identity gossiping</a>, as well as OOB verification help detect such an attack.</p>
<h3 id="revocation-suppression"><a class="header" href="#revocation-suppression">Revocation suppression</a></h3>
<p>Users need to be able to remove lost or potentially compromised devices from their composed identity. Here, the problem is often that a malicious messaging provider can (silently) drop messages performing such a revocation operation. This can not be prevented entirely, since the messaging provider can always decide to drop messages. <a href="authentication_systems/./authentication_systems.html#identity-gossiping">Identity gossiping</a> can help mitigate this problem, as it prevents the messaging provider from dropping messages selectively. Instead, the provider is forced to drop all of a user's messages, thus significantly increasing the risk of detection.</p>
<p>Such an attack is also detected if two affected users verify one-another's identities OOB.</p>
<h3 id="identity-gossiping"><a class="header" href="#identity-gossiping">Identity Gossiping</a></h3>
<p>Some of the techniques discussed above (such as cross signing) help in ensuring that all participants of a given conversation agree on their respective identities. However, if the messaging protocol (cryptographically) includes the identity of a user in messages it sends, it can help mitigate the two attacks described above.</p>
<p>If the authentication systems includes a <a href="authentication_systems/authentication_systems.html#verifiable-data-structures">verifyable data structure</a> that records fingerprints of client identities, clients can also gossip their view of the data structure.</p>
<h2 id="signal"><a class="header" href="#signal">Signal</a></h2>
<p>The Signal app takes the TTP approach to authentication with <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed-">optional OOB verification by the user</a>. Users can discover other users via the Signal servers. Once a connection is established with another user, the server provides both users with the cryptographic identities of their peers. The same is true if a user joins a group with other users with whom it doesn’t necessarily have a previous connection.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can verify the identity of other users out-of-band, either by comparing a numerical code or by scanning a QR code. Notably, the code presented by the Signal app is not the cryptographic identity of a specific user, but instead a byte string specific to the connection between the users.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client"><a class="header" href="#multi-client">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>Signal provisions all clients of a user with the same cryptographic identity, thus allowing users to perform OOB verification a single time to verify the cryptographic identity of all of the clients of a given user.</p>
<p>Since all clients have the same identity and thus can’t be told apart cryptographically, there is no way to revoke the individual cryptographic identity of a client. However, client removal is still possible with the assistance of the Signal server, which manages the message queues of individual clients.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapp"><a class="header" href="#whatsapp">WhatsApp</a></h2>
<p>WhatsApp uses the same general approach to authentication as Signal. Cryptographic identities are distributed via the WhatsApp servers, which act as TTPs. Users can additionally verify the safety numbers OOB, with the app providing the ability to scan another user’s safety number via a QR code. However, safety numbers are computed differently than by the Signal app, which is due to WhatsApp’s different approach to multi-client.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client-1"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-1">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>Even though both applications share the underlying protocol, WhatsApp takes a different approach to multiple clients than Signal. Instead of sharing a cryptographic identity, each client has its own, distinct identity. Consequently, the <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/791574747982248/?locale=en_US">safety number</a> for a pair of users is computed from the set of clients of both users. Thus, when comparing safety numbers OOB, users also verify their view of each other’s clients.</p>
<p>If a client is added, WhatsApp takes a <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/">cross-signing approach</a> in addition to the TTP approach with optional OOB verification. When adding a new client, an existing client is required to sign the cryptographic identity of the new one. This does not happen automatically but instead requires the user to scan the identity of the new client using the existing one. The signed identity of the new client is then sent to the peers of the user. The user’s peers can thus trust the new client as much as it trusted the existing client. In particular, if user and peer previously verified safety codes OOB, they do not have to do so again after the addition of the new client.</p>
<p>Similarly, the user can revoke its own clients with an existing client authenticating the revocation.</p>
<h2 id="keybase"><a class="header" href="#keybase">Keybase</a></h2>
<p>Keybase keeps a <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/teams/sigchain">signature chain</a> as the user’s cryptographic identity. That signature chain contains the identities of all of the users’ clients and can, optionally, include other “proofs of identity”, such as a link to a social media account. This link is verified by the Keybase servers rather than by other end users. The chain can only be extended by the user’s clients. The chain is never shortened and clients are removed by recording the removal in the chain rather than shortening or changing the chain.</p>
<p>Since the chain is distributed by the Keybase servers, the approach is a TTP approach with optional OOB verification and added links to external (non-cryptographic) identities.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client-2"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-2">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>Each client has its own cryptographic identity. A new client is added to the chain by an existing client upon creation. Similarly, client removals are recorded on the chain by the client performing the removal.</p>
<h2 id="threema"><a class="header" href="#threema">Threema</a></h2>
<p>Threema follows a TTP approach with optional OOB verification (see page 6 on <a href="https://threema.ch/press-files/2_documentation/cryptography_whitepaper.pdf">Threema’s cryptography whitepaper</a>). Threema is special in that it very prominently displays the degree of authentication for a given contact. If the cryptographic identity of a given contact was simply fetched from the Threema server, it shows a single red point. If there is a phone number or email address associated with the contact that is already in the user’s address book, it shows two orange points (this is essentially still relying entirely on the TTP). Finally, if the user has performed an OOB verification, it shows three green points.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client-3"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-3">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>The multi-client approach taken by Threema is not reflected in the user’s cryptographic identity (see page 20 and following in the whitepaper linked above). There is a primary (mobile) client, with the option to open a secondary client in a browser. That client does not have its own cryptographic identity but instead relays messages through the primary client.</p>
<p>The secondary clients can be managed by the primary client.</p>
<h2 id="pgp"><a class="header" href="#pgp">PGP</a></h2>
<p>PGP follows the web of trust approach with optional OOB verification. As described above, users can use their cryptographic identities to sign those of other users. This usually happens after the user has verified OOB that a given identity indeed belongs to the user in question. A user who has no way to verify an identity OOB can then check the existing signatures on the identity and decide, depending on how much the user trusts the judgment of the signers if the it can trust the identity in question.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client-4"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-4">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>PGP doesn’t have a notion of clients specifically and instead requires the user to manage its own key material. It is thus possible to either use different identities on different clients or just use the same on all clients. The user is also free to choose if and how to cross-sign the identities or to use a hierarchy of identities.</p>
<h2 id="element"><a class="header" href="#element">Element</a></h2>
<p>Element clients obtain the identity of their peers from their respective home servers, which act as trusted third parties. In addition, Element allows the verification of users OOB either in an interactive process, where users compare a sequence of Emoji in real-time or by comparing the full “session key” (which is presumably the client’s Curve25519 identity key). The former approach has to happen in real-time, which allows Element to only display a short sequence of emoji, while the latter can happen asynchronously.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client-5"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-5">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>Element clients have distinct identity keys. When a new client is created, it <a href="https://element.io/enterprise/device-verification">can be cross-signed</a> by an existing client. Thus, when performing the OOB verification process described above, all cross-signed clients are verified at once. Interestingly, after an OOB verification took place, new clients have to be verified even after they were cross-signed by an existing client. See also the Matrix specification for <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#cross-signing">cross-signing</a>.</p>
<p>Peers keep track of a user’s clients (<em>devices</em> in the Matrix specification) by periodically checking the user’s list of devices. If a user changes its list of devices, e.g. by removing a device, its peers will learn of this when they next synchronize with their respective homeservers.</p>
<h2 id="imessage"><a class="header" href="#imessage">iMessage</a></h2>
<p>iMessage <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/how-imessage-sends-and-receives-messages-sec70e68c949/web">purely relies on the TTP approach</a>, where Apple distributes the cryptographic identities of individual parties to conversation partners. There is no way for parties to verify their peers’ public keys OOB.</p>
<h3 id="multi-client-6"><a class="header" href="#multi-client-6">Multi-client</a></h3>
<p>iMessage clients have their own cryptographic identity and Apple automatically distributes keys of new clients, as well as changes to a user’s client list to a user’s contacts.</p>
<h1 id="comparison-of-messaging-applications"><a class="header" href="#comparison-of-messaging-applications">Comparison of messaging applications</a></h1>
<p>Due to the diversity of approaches to authentication in general and multi-device in particular, it is hard to compare the individual applications directly. However, we can categorize them broadly. Note that none of the applications below support transparency via a verifiable datastructure or verification via a verification question. The composed identity colum determines if the application exposes a fingerprint of the <a href="authentication_systems/authentication_systems.html#multi-client-or-composed-user-identities">composed user identity</a> (as opposed to the identities of the individual clients).</p>
